		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Charlene! :) I really hope I can go since I&#039;m only a few hours from NYC! Do you think you&#039;ll be attending? I love to talk classics with you over scones and tea! ;) Actually, I was thinking of eventually doing a french classic lit mini-event in the new year (ie talking about Les MisÃ©rables, The 3 Musketeers, The Count of Monte Cristo). I&#039;m not sure how/what it would be like but let me know if you think that&#039;s something you&#039;d be interested in! 

It seems like connecting with the blogger community is a big one for everyone! Luckily it&#039;s such a friendly community.

I&#039;m so excited for the sci-fi event and that you and so many others are also participating! I&#039;m still figuring out what my posts are going to be though... :P]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[HAI TORY! Haha I guess I just need to assume and rock my classy reviewer status!! ;) I&#039;m so excited for sci-fi month!!! It&#039;s gonna be so much fun! I&#039;m still trying to figure out all my posts though... that&#039;s been a challenge in a good way! 

You definitely need to leave the castle! I do understand how hard it is to break out of your usual genre into another. It took me a long time to start reading YA/romance but once I did, I loved it! I&#039;m hoping my reviews manage to sway you into trying one of them someday! ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations! I&#039;ve been blogging for about 3-4 months on The Sirenic Codex and it&#039;s fun! Like you, I need to deal with not getting many comments on posts I work extremely hard on. It&#039;s weird sometimes when a post I thought was okay gets much more recognition than something I worked hard on. I deal with it by talking with my co-blogger, Mari. (Co-bloggers are the best, aren&#039;t they?!) I love your goals. Anyway, I&#039;m looking forward to reading even more from you!]]></description>
