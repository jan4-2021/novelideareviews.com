		<description><![CDATA[So, so true! I come home from a long day at work, and often I&#039;ll just start working on the blog right away. Sometimes it&#039;s because I want to get things done and have ideas that I need to get down, other times it&#039;s because I&#039;ve got something scheduled and now is the time to fit it in! 

It does make me mad when bad reviews get bashed. Do these authors want actual constructive criticism, or do they just want praise and sales? The latter suggests all they care about is money, not the actual process of writing and connecting with readers and potential fans.

I blog purely because I enjoy it. I love the community, I love writing - I&#039;m no good at writing my own fiction, but I enjoy writing reviews, discussions etc, just like I always really enjoyed researching and writing papers at university. We should all be proud of our blogs =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Sandra! Thanks for stopping by our blog! :)

It is A LOT of time and effort to run a blog, especially a book blog, cause you&#039;re not just writing posts but also reading. And many of us have HUGE piles of books to read haha. Well, okay, I think that&#039;s true of everyone I know who blogs about books! I agree that bloggers have gained so much influence over the past few years and I personally would trust a book blogger&#039;s opinion of a book over a review from a journalist or publicist. 

So glad you enjoy blogging so far!! We both wish you all the best with your blog. Don&#039;t hesitate to chat with us on Twitter or Goodreads too, we love making new friends :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We share the same reasons for blogging -- high fives and hugs!! :D Good for you, I know it must be hard to juggle school and blogging. But you&#039;re right, the juggling part is one reason why successfully running a blog even with all the other things going on at the same time feels more rewarding!

It makes me sad that book bloggers get overlooked and don&#039;t get the appreciation they deserve. Personally I trust book bloggers to tell me if a book is good or bad, not a journalist or a paid publicist. Because bloggers like us are readers, first and foremost, so we know what&#039;s up! 

Thanks Hazel &lt;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed!!! It seems like no one I know in real life likes to read either?? Every time they catch me reading they act all politely interested but not really haha. Good for you, it&#039;s no good getting stressed out over blogging so I&#039;m glad you are able to find a balance and forgive yourself when things don&#039;t work out as planned! 

I&#039;ve had a very positive experience with authors so far so I feel bad for them because the authors who attack reviewers have made things strained for a lot of people. Ah, I didn&#039;t know that Leigh Bardugo did that, how lovely! I think bloggers do so much and it&#039;s nice to see them honored for it in some way!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh I totally agree -- sometimes I wonder if they understand that a review consists of someone&#039;s opinion and that everyone is entitled to one of those! And yes, it is very very hard to put your work out there, something that means so much to you, and take the criticism that follows, whether thats constructive criticism (still tough for a perfectionist like me) or the negative criticism that no one ever wants. I would prefer readers were honest because I could use their feedback to improve and grow. 

Coffee is always calling for me!! I have some right now, in fact!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t people understand how much work &amp; time, us bloggers, dedicate to blogging and even accusing a blogger of bullying or abuse because you&#039;re too immature to take on critique is extremely hurting and disrespectful of our work. Which is even more highlighted considering how much influence bloggers have now, how much hype they can make and by attacking bloggers you somehow destroy that.

Moving on, even though I have my blog for only about three months I can say I love it. It&#039;s my favourite hobby, even if it&#039;s a time consuming one. I already met many amazing people and got some great recommendations for books that I wouldn&#039;t have picked up on my own. But daamn, school gets in my way a lot lately. There&#039;s just too much work for my nerves. Thankfully I have October break right now so I can catch up on blogging, reading and reviewing ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m crazy about books- always have been, always will be. I blog about books because of my love for it and I continue blogging because I&#039;ve come to love this community so much. I have so many other things to do but I choose to do this because it is what I&#039;m passionate about. Juggling between book blogging and my academics is hard but the former is so rewarding and makes the effort so so worth it.

I do think that some people overlook us book bloggers and not appreciate us enough. I guess they don&#039;t understand the work we put in here. Needless to say, there are some authors who really are so thankful when you write a review about their book- whether good or not so much. :) Great post, Paola! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely blog for fun as well! It&#039;s just a great way to meet other people who feel as passionate about books as I do- because pretty much all the people I know in real life don&#039;t read *sigh*. In terms of juggling life and blogging, it&#039;s definitely difficult. So I think I tend to have a kind of &quot;do what I can&quot; policy. I don&#039;t beat myself up for skipping a couple of scheduled posts or whatever, because it is pretty hard to keep up with posting regularly when uni/school/work gets in the way.

I guess there is a lack of appreciation in some ways, but from most authors, there&#039;s appreciation abounds! For example, have you seen at the start of Siege and Storm there&#039;s a list of all the bloggers that the publisher thanks for all their support? That&#039;s pretty awesome, especially since I actually know some of the bloggers on there!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I do wonder if some of these people understand the nature of a review... do they want us to throw our integrity out the window and just sit here stroking the egos of petulant authors? I know from experience that it is really hard when other people critique your work, especially when it&#039;s done in such a public way, but if you can&#039;t take it then you should not be publishing books. Wouldn&#039;t you rather have the occasional bad word said about your writing than suspect that all your good reviews were written just so bloggers don&#039;t get cyber-attacked?! Ugh! I&#039;m in caffeine-deprived rant mode... coffee calls!]]></description>
