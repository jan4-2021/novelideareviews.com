<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73884089-e18a-b3bc-d12e-83ce9f8c4ecc" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Guess what time of the year it is? Itâsâ¦.. NOVEMBER! And that meansâ¦.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: â¦ NaNoWriMo! Or, <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>, in case you arenât familiar with the crazy 30 days of the year when aspiring writers try to write a 50k novel in one month. <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte </a>and I are both participating this year, and we wanted to reach out to others who might be doing the same thing. (You know, all the other crazy people.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: (Doing all these crazy things haha) Basically our support group is not just limited to bloggers, weâre inviting all bookish people to participate! So you can either just make blog posts, discuss and chat in our GR group and so on! The whole point of our support group is to provide well literally, support to all fellow writers out there attempting NaNoWriMo this year and to help you get through those gruelling 30 days!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Weâll be here for you through whatever youâre going through in your writing adventures (err, or misadventuresâ¦) and we hope the support group will become a fun community where you can talk about your project, get constructive criticism and inspiration, or just hang out when you feel like your brain is about to explode.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Weâve got your back in November ;) Youâre not alone in this, Writers Unite!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3992"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: <em><strong>To sign up, just <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">fill out the form</a> to be added to the list of participants.</strong></em> We also have a group on Goodreads specifically for the event; youâll find the link at the end of the <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">sign-up form</a>! Once youâve done this, you have until the end of October to write up an intro post.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: <em><strong>For your intro post, tell us a little bit about yourselves and your NaNo experience &#8211; have you participated before? Is this your first time? Any challenges you think youâll face? What are your goals? And if you feel comfortable sharing with us, maybe the synopsis of your novel or the title :)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: You can write your intro post any time before November 1st and add it to our linky list on <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/writers-unite-participant-list/" target="_blank">the participants page</a> over here!

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the event weâll be posting about our progress once a week, and we hope you will too! Bloggers and non-bloggers can participate in this; if you donât have a blog, weâll have a thread in the Goodreads group where you can talk about how youâre doing. Also, on Wednesdays weâll be doing some fun posts to get into the writing spirit! Here are some ideas for topics you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Interview one of your characters</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Come up with a playlist for your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Dream cast your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Essential tools that help you write</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: The fun posts are optional so donât feel pressurised to make sure you get a post up every Wednesday. If youâre going through Writerâs Block or need to just write something else apart from your novel, these posts can be a great help!</p>

So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Mindy McGinnis</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Dystopian</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013, Katherine Tegen Books</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 320 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RELATED POST</strong>: <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days Tour Recap</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a world where fresh water is rare enough to kill for, Lynn and her mother spend their days on the roof of their house. The focus of every day is defending the pond on their property, which is their main source of water, and which is consequently a prime target for others who are desperate to survive. Life is a battle for Lynn, and it only intensifies when shots in the dark and smoke on the horizon signal both a beginning and an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, this book would&#8217;ve flown under my radar if not for my good friend <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte at Gypsy Reviews</a>, who told me I needed to pick it up while I was at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/"><strong>Dark Days Tour</strong></a> signing last month! So thanks for the recommendation, Charlotte!! I was lucky enough to meet author Mindy McGinnis during the event &#8212; she signed my book (<a href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/photo_2-2/" target="_blank">and tore the title page</a>, but she drew a smiley face next to it so all was well in the end! haha) and also signed a bookmark for me to give away! <strong>Details on how to win are at the end of this post :)</strong> And be sure to read <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">my recap of the Dark Days Tour</a> stop in Vegas for what Mindy had to say about her debut novel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3911"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> is pretty stark on the surface &#8212; Lynn and her mother are fighting for survival in a bleak, dystopian society. I know a lot of us have had enough of dystopia in YA these days, but I have to say that this one stands out from the crowd. Not only is the survival aspect very realistic and believable, it&#8217;s also infused with an undercurrent of hope and the possibility of change for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that it was such a no-frills narrative. The writing is readable but not so simplistic that it detracts from the emotional content. You really get a feel for the kind of life Lynn leads, which is not forgiving or easy at all. The environment is harsh, riddled with dangers that need to be guarded against at all times. From a very young age, she&#8217;s been forced to sink or swim. Sometimes when I read dystopia, it&#8217;s really hard to get into the atmosphere because too many frivolous things litter the story &#8212; love triangles, insta-love, extraneous drama &#8212; all the usual suspects that make it seem like they&#8217;re too busy being emo to actually get to the business of surviving. This isn&#8217;t the case with <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>. Every minute of every day is precious, and every day in itself is hard won.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist, Lynn, has never known a world that didn&#8217;t demand this kind of struggle. She&#8217;s been raised by her mother, learning to grow a thick skin and move through life without hesitating to kill if that&#8217;s what it takes to survive another day. They defend their pond against man and beast &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter who. And because she&#8217;s been raised to trust no one but her mother, Lynn is a character that sometimes displays a really callous personality. It kind of bothered me at times just how unfeeling she could be, but it&#8217;s worthwhile to remember that this is all she&#8217;s ever been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until events cause massive change in her life, Lynn is resistant to any type of change at all and even more resistant when it comes to depending on other people. She&#8217;s wary of going beyond the small circle of her comfort zone, and the crazy thing here is that what&#8217;s &#8220;comfortable&#8221; for Lynn would probably be SUPER uncomfortable for a big baby like me, haha. The good thing is that she undergoes this massive amount of growth by the time the story ends. She&#8217;s still tough as nails, and she still has a very black and white, straight up survivalist outlook on life, but her heart becomes more open. She experiences love and friendship that temper her previous experiences of loss and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a romance in this book, but it&#8217;s pretty low key. The highlight of the story is Lynn&#8217;s relationship with a little girl named Lucy who teaches her both how to care for another person and how to be cared for in return. I really appreciated this aspect of the story, as well as Lynn&#8217;s growing acceptance and eventual friendship with her neighbor, Stebbs. Overall, what makes this novel is not the stark reality of a world without fresh water and what that means; instead, it&#8217;s about fighting for the people you love.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a solid standalone novel and one that I recommend for anyone looking for a true survival story &#8212; the author knows her stuff! As she mentioned during the Dark Days event, her actual lifestyle is very similar to Lynn&#8217;s! (Not because she shoots people from her roof if they come near her pond&#8230; haha!)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Speaking of Mindy, she was kind enough to sign an extra bookmark for me to give away to one of you! So if you want to win that signed bookmark, leave me a comment answering the following question:</strong></h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Do you think you could survive in a post-apocalyptic or dystopian world? What strategies would you use to make it through?</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You can be as brief or verbose as you want. I&#8217;ll choose one comment as the winner. This is open to international readers as well; please do read <a title="Giveaway Policy" href="http://novelideareviews.com/giveaway-policy/">our giveaway policy</a> before entering!

Specifically, the fine art of juggling my never-ending TBR pile, being a grown up, trying to write a manuscript, answering the question, &#8220;Teacher, is it Halloween yet?&#8221; 12 billion times a day, figuring out what to do for dinner, editing a gigantic pile of photos from my last session, AND finding time to blog, all at the same time. As you might guess, it&#8217;s a little bit ridiculous. Also, it&#8217;s exhausting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">September was probably the craziest month we&#8217;ve ever had on the blog to date, and you may have noticed a drop in the number of posts here around that last week or so. To put it simply, life attacked with a vengeance. I caught this new and particularly ferocious cold/virus/THING right around then (thanks, preschool) and it also happened to be when Alix ended up completely slammed at work. We were skipping scheduled posts left and right, drafts remaining unwritten and growing cold and lonely on our calendar while we struggled to maintain equilibrium in our hectic offline lives. We were silent on Twitter. We let the blog slip into a state of temporary hibernation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3957"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was really hard on me because upkeep of this blog is a pretty big deal in my life. Through this blog, I&#8217;ve made friends and discovered amazing books and made a lot of really incredible memories. Running it with Alix is my #1 hobby, out of all my dozens of hobbies; it&#8217;s kind of like this crazy unpaid job that I&#8217;ve devoted countless hours to, and I know that a lot of you out there feel the same way. I think that&#8217;s why, when the latest Goodreads debacle took place recently, I well and truly felt slapped in the face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I feel this way anytime book bloggers are accused of bullying, or being overly critical, or criticized themselves for (gasp!) having an opinion. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair, and here&#8217;s why: <em><strong>for so many of us, book blogging is a labor of love</strong></em>. We do this because we love books, because we have things to say about books, and because we want more than anything to share our love with the entire universe. At least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m in it for. I don&#8217;t do this for money. I don&#8217;t do this because I&#8217;m bored &#8212; far from it. I have a pretty full plate over here. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in saying that I blog because I love it, and I make time for it because of that. If it ever stops being fun, or if it ever starts to become more about what others think and want instead of what we think and want, I&#8217;ll be done blogging. Because that would render all of this pointless.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When book bloggers as a whole are put down for &#8220;bullying&#8221; and &#8220;author abuse&#8221; and other assorted crimes, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if all these people out there have any idea how much work we really put in &#8212; how much time and effort it takes, all the reading time we snag during lunch breaks and commutes because we committed to reviewing something, all the mental anguish when we love an author but not their book. The list goes on and on. I mean, it&#8217;s a complex equation. It doesn&#8217;t just amount to, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re mean because you didn&#8217;t like this book. You&#8217;re an awful, awful person and a bully as well.&#8221; I believe we have a right to express our feelings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And really, what it amounts to is that we will always say and do whatever we like on our blog, regardless of what others might think is right or wrong when it comes to book blogging. It&#8217;s our time that we&#8217;ve invested, in reading and writing up posts and coming up with features. We could be doing other things, but we choose to do this. I know a lot of you out there feel the same way. So don&#8217;t lose sight of the reason why you blog, whatever that reason might be. Keep it with you even when life is crazy and you can&#8217;t stick to your schedule. Remember it when you feel discouraged by negativity and lack of support. None of that stuff matters as long as you&#8217;re still doing something that makes you happy. At least, that&#8217;s how I see things.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What about you? Why do you blog, and how do you juggle life + blogging? Do you think there&#8217;s a lack of appreciation for book bloggers in the industry?</h2>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Holly Black</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Paranormal/Urban Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013; Little, Brown BFYR</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtownâs gates, you can never leave.</p>
<p>One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been such a long time since I read a vampire book I enjoyed this much &#8212; I was well and truly impressed with the gritty and yet oddly glamorous world of Holly Black&#8217;s vampires and the humans who co-exist with them. I loved that the story was full of both beauty and blood. I loved the entire pop culture phenomenon she created around vampirism. I loved her heroine. I JUST LOVED IT OKAY.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about the world we see in this novel is that it&#8217;s so very believable, especially when you consider modern culture and the things society values and finds entertaining right now, as we speak. Holly Black&#8217;s vampires are relegated to Coldtowns, where they are walled away from the rest of the population but still the center of a universe that is inexorably drawn to their allure. Magnetic, fascinating, and infinitely dangerous, they are both feared and yet hopelessly admired. It was crazy seeing vampirism from this angle. There are vampire tourist traps, vampire blogs, vampire hunter shows littered with crossbows and imagery that ranges from the grotesquely fascinating to just plain grotesque.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3305"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Immortal, the vampires celebrate a night that never ends, which in turn is accessible to anyone with cable. This atmosphere was conveyed with masterful execution that gave the reader insight into a lot of different perspectives, from the blogger obsessed with being immortal to the rest of the population that lives outside all of that glory and gore, still striving to live the most normal lives possible in the wake of a vampirism epidemic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This vividly rendered world would be pointless without the right kind of heroine, and I&#8217;m happy to say that Tana is absolutely right for her role. I loved that she was so determined to hang on to who she was, even when it would have been easier to give in and let go of every shred of humanity she possessed. She&#8217;s a fighter in so many ways. I liked her attitude, her practical acceptance that in order to get through this ordeal she would have to do things that would not only hurt her, but possibly hurt others as well. I guess I just like that kind of personality in my heroines. When you&#8217;re faced with a terrible situation, do you panic and fall apart, or do you get a grip and keep moving on? Tana chooses the latter. A lot of shit goes down, but she sticks to her ideals and what&#8217;s important to her. I can&#8217;t help but respect that in a character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mean, Tana manages to stay true to herself even with GAVRIEL to deal with. Guys, we can&#8217;t talk about him, okay? Because I will start screaming and flailing and just turn into a pile of slush. Here is a complex character in every sense of the word. We never know what&#8217;s going on with him. We&#8217;re never entirely sure where his allegiance lies. He proves to be both unpredictable and slightly deranged, but it&#8217;s somehow perfect. The attraction between these two is ridiculous and heart-stopping and again, somehow perfect. I have to say that Gavriel is one of my favorite leading men (and vampires) ever.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely loved it. And it&#8217;s not part of a series, but this is one of those rare occasions when I kind of found myself wishing it was a series, because I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of the world and the characters (and Gavriel, ahem) in only one book. That being said, I also love that it was a standalone in a genre dominated by series. You get closure, even if you don&#8217;t get to have more delicious vampire men. /sigh/ Oh, fine. Anyway, highly recommended &#8212; definitely the best vampire book I&#8217;ve read since Robin McKinley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8088.Sunshine?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sunshine</em></a>, which is saying something when you consider that <em>Sunshine</em> happens to be <a title="#26: SUNSHINE" href="http://novelideareviews.com/26-sunshine/" target="_blank">one of my favorite books of all time</a> AND combines the immortal undead with tons of cinnamon rolls. I mean, could you get a higher recommendation from me based on this??? No. <strong>So go get this book!!</strong> (And <em>Sunshine</em> too, okay??)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-journey-home-a-celebration-of-the-lumatere-chronicles/"><img alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Unlike my experience actually reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> for the first time, the story behind how I discovered the book isn&#8217;t at all exciting. I devour fantasy books on a regular basis and I&#8217;m always looking for my next escape, which is what led me to Lumatere. I remember skimming through a few reviews on Goodreads and finding myself compelled by the sheer amount of people who were rendered incoherent and/or speechless by this book. This got me thinking that I should probably pick it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="finnpost01" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/finnpost01-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></strong>Some 400 pages later, I realized this had been one of the best literary moments of my life. EVER. But I&#8217;d packed my bags and applied for permanent citizenship long before that. Maybe it was the first time Evanjalin rolled her eyes at Finnikin. (And all the subsequent times hahaha) Maybe it was every single time these characters kept going, never giving up on the home they&#8217;d been forced to leave behind. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on when it happened exactly, but somewhere on that journey I decided I belonged there too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3909"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think many of us who read fantasy are drawn to the genre because A) it gives us a chance to get away to an entirely different world and/or B) it gives us a chance to live in a world where the epic and the legendary are still possible. Lumatere exemplifies both, for me. This is a place where there is power in every promise, where honor and loyalty still matter, where love is unbreakable. These are people who do absolutely nothing by halves, whether it&#8217;s living or loving or dying. It&#8217;s where friendship is a bond that lasts forever, where I&#8217;ve witnessed every possible way to be brave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It never ceases to amaze. Melina Marchetta is capable of rendering me into a sobbing, laughing, inarticulate mess with only one sentence. This universe of hers even seems to be rendered in colors more vivid than the ones in our spectrum, to the point that reading this series somehow made me feel more <em>alive</em>. And I guess this feeling just makes me want to take this book and give it to everyone I meet. I just want you to see what I see. I want you to experience this crazy, crushing, heartbreaking, exhilarating, BEAUTIFUL feeling. It&#8217;s why I came to Lumatere and never left.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ack!! Sorry for the delay on this!! I&#8217;ve had a crazy week (and a half&#8230;?) since the last installment of this recap &#8212; first I caught the worst cold I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, then I was subsequently slammed with work and endless amounts of Grown-Up Responsibilities that ended up leaving no time at all for blogging. *sobs* Anyway, here is the fourth and final post in my Persuasion recap! If you missed the previous installments, here they are: <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank"><strong>Part I (Intro &amp; Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>, <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank"><strong>Part II (Chapters 8-12)</strong></a>, and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 3" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-3/" target="_blank"><strong>Part III (Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a> may be over, but Alix and I have decided that my <del>shenanigans</del> recaps will carry on as a feature on the blog! (This is the part where everyone runs away screaming.) So, at the end of this post I&#8217;m giving you a chance to tell me <strong>which Austen classic I should recap next</strong>! Please remember that with this great power comes great responsibility, et al etc.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></span>: This is the grand finale of <em>Persuasion</em>, so brace yourself for ALL THE FEELS!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter Seven</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh snap! Mrs. Clay, are you now gunning for Cousin Elliott instead of Sir Walter??! You gold-digging minx, you! Not that this worked since Cousin E decided to go walking in the rain with Anne. Which, of course, is when Wentworth finally decides to come back into our story! (A wild Wentworth appears! SNORT) After seeing this other dude taking walks in the rain with Anne, Wentworth decides that he ALSO wants to do this. Plus he wants to show off his shiny new umbrella. But Cousin E interrupts the conversation, and a stroll with Anne is not in the cards for Wentworth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the days pass, Wentworth sightings continue to take place all around Bath. Even Lady Russell takes some time to stare at him. She covers this up by pretending to be staring at some really snazzy drawing room curtains instead. Smooth, Lady R. Anne says nothing about this but does make some private commentary on &#8220;the elegant stupidity of private parties.&#8221; Because she&#8217;s Anne, and sometimes snarky, even if she doesn&#8217;t ever say these things out loud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the chapter, everyone is in full freak-out mode over an upcoming concert. Anne doesn&#8217;t really want to go&#8230; until she realizes that Wentworth might be there. #Gamechanger</p>
<p><span id="more-3678"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Wentworth does indeed attend the concert. He and Anne have a brief chat about Benwick and Louisa&#8217;s surprise engagement, during which Wentworth expresses his own concerns that the two aren&#8217;t alike enough. He can&#8217;t believe how easily Benwick got over his fiancee, the tragic Fanny Harville; &#8220;A man does not recover from such devotion of the heart to such a woman!&#8221; OH REALLY???? HMMMMMMMMMM</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, Wentworth adds that he does feel responsible for what happened to Louisa. Anne makes some sympathetic noises but mostly just shrugs and is like, &#8220;Ah, well, but I do hope I get to go back to Lyme someday cause that place was awesome. Just saying.&#8221; This is because she&#8217;s secretly rendered incoherent by Wentworth&#8217;s mini-speech about never being able to get over certain women one falls in love with. Is there hope in this awkward, angsty situation after all??!!! Except before any more of this riveting conversation can continue, Cousin Elliott appears on the scene and proceeds to go through with THE MOST UNWANTED INTERRUPTION OF ALL TIME. SERIOUSLY, DUDE?????</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dismayed Anne watches Wentworth return to his own seat while Cousin Elliott starts confessing that he&#8217;s heard all sorts of lovely things about Anne and that he thinks very highly of her AND ALSO BTW I&#8217;M GOING TO SORT OF PROPOSE TO YOU NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONCERT. (Yes, this happened.) Anne rendered speechless; resolves to flee ASAP. After intermission, she makes up her mind to go sit next to Wentworth and all the readers in the world stand up and just cheer for hours on end UNTIL COUSIN ELLIOTT COMES BACK TO RUIN THE MOMENT AGAIN DAMNIT GO AWAY JSKDHFKJSDHF</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SDHFFHJSGDFHJSFKJHDJKFH</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the days following the concert, Anne devotes all her energy to avoiding Cousin Elliott like the plague. She decides to visit her old friend Mrs. Smith, her former governess, who (if you remember from last installment) is now a destitute cripple but still a very sweet lady. She figures no one in her family, including Cousin E, would be caught dead consorting with destitute, crippled widows and that Mrs. Smith&#8217;s house is the safest place to hide right now. But when she gets there, Mrs. Smith starts being super weird about the whole Cousin E thing, going so far as to tell Anne that she expected to hear news of an engagement that day, and that she thinks Cousin E is a great guy, et al etc. Anne is confused and chooses to investigate further, whereupon Mrs. Smith suddenly pulls a complete 180 and condemns Cousin E as a Grade A Douchebag&#8230; what is going on??!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a considerable amount of hemming and hawing, Mrs Smith divulges that she has known Cousin E for quite some time. In fact, he used to be a very close friend of hers through her late husband, back when Cousin E was much less monetarily endowed and would come hang out with them/mooch off their food and hospitality all the time. Apparently he married his first wife (now also deceased) for her money rather than marrying Anne&#8217;s sister Elizabeth way back when. Mrs Smith produces an incriminating letter that proves what a lying, scheming, gold digging brigand Cousin Elliott really is. Behold, a list of his dastardly crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisted in ruining the Smith family finances, eventually leading to the demise of Mr. Smith and leaving Mrs. Smith a destitute, crippled widow.</li>
<li>Was the executor of Mr. Smith&#8217;s will, and yet refuses to assist Mrs. Smith in claiming property and money that is due to her and which might just reverse her fortunes.</li>
<li>Decided to re-insinuate himself in the Elliott family&#8217;s good graces when he realized that Mrs. Clay, that (fellow) conniving, gold-digging minx, had plans to try and marry Sir Walter. And lady, this town ain&#8217;t big enough for the both of us. /cue gunfight in Austen novel</li>
<li>Is now planning to foil Mrs. Clay&#8217;s marriage prospects AND marry Anne himself&#8230;!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After listening to all this, Anne realizes just how close she came to being persuaded YET AGAIN to make the wrong decision. If she&#8217;d listened to Lady Russell&#8217;s babbling about how awesome it would be to marry Cousin Elliott and become mistress of Kellynch Hall just like her mother used to be, Anne would be in the same capsizing ship all over again. She resolves to tell Lady R everything she&#8217;s just learned about the true depths of Cousin E&#8217;s utter douchebaggery.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a true professional Queen Douchebag, Elizabeth manages to &#8220;send her love&#8221; to Lady Russell while simultaneously putting down her taste in books and ridiculing her fashion sense. Hey, this kind of jackass behavior takes skill, okay? Speaking of jackasses, Sir Walter tacks on HIS love to Lady Russell while also criticizing how disheveled she looks in the morning. Ah, the apple doesn&#8217;t fall far from the tree~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With perfect timing, another bad apple rolls into town &#8212; none other than our favorite crybaby hypochondriac, Mary! Right behind her are a bunch of the Musgroves visiting from Uppercross. Anne&#8217;s visit to Lady R is put off as she is pulled into social calls with the Musgroves and learns all about the upcoming weddings planned for Louisa and Henrietta. She is genuinely happy for both of the girls and mostly enjoys seeing everyone again (minus Mary, cause who would really want to see her??) but of course Wentworth soon arrives to have dinner with them all and brings a whole lot of Awkward with him. Anne and Wentworth are careful to stand on opposite sides of the room while secretly wrestling with inner turmoil. Mary, renowned busybody, happens to glance out the window and see some sort of furtive exchange going on between Mrs Clay and Cousin Elliott out on the street. This gets everyone talking about Anne and Cousin E; Anne is consequently upset that all of Bath seems to think she&#8217;s marrying that punk. Eeewwwwww.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the pleasure of watching Mary and her husband have another of their fun little marital squabbles, Sir William and Elizabeth crash the party in order to invite everyone to THEIR party on the following night. Because, appropriate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the following day, Anne is hanging out at the hotel with the visitors from Uppercross. Mrs. Musgrove and Mrs. Croft (wife of Admiral Croft, tenant at the Elliott family&#8217;s estate, Kellynch Hall) are avidly discussing short engagements versus long engagements and seem to favor the latter option. Long engagements are apparently the worst idea ever. Wentworth pretends he isn&#8217;t listening. Pffftttt WHATEVER, WENTWORTH. Captain Harville (seafaring friend of Wentworth) randomly starts talking to Anne about his late sister Fanny, who was engaged to Benwick. He shows Anne a portrait of Benwick that had been commissioned for Fanny, but which is now being made over for Benwick&#8217;s new fiancee Louisa Musgrove. He laments that Fanny would not have &#8220;forgotten&#8221; Benwick as quickly as Benwick forgot about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne agrees, and in her BEST speech ever in the whole book, she makes a fantastic argument basically stating that women do not forget love as easily as men do. Wentworth continues to pretend that he isn&#8217;t listening&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BUT THEN HE PASSES HER A NOTE (MIDDLE SCHOOL STYLE) AND IT IS THE BEST NOTE EVER AND JUST EEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKK KJDHFKSJDHFKJSDHFKJSDFHKJSDHF THIS IS THE SOUND OF ME DYING OF THE FEELS</strong></h3>
<p>(in my notes this moment is marked by me writing the word <strong>EEEEEKKKKKKK</strong> in gigantic all-caps letters that take up like 5 lines)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>***Pause for customary moment of unabashed flailing after being facepunched by feels***</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WENTWORTH AND ANNE RENEW THEIR ENGAGEMENT. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sir Walter finally writes this down in his precious book of the British Peerage (LOL). Lady Russell is made to writhe in agony as her long-ago prediction of doom and misfortune is proven COMPLETELY WRONG. Ha!!! Mary, of course, decides to take all the credit for her sister&#8217;s match with Wentworth but also suffers quite a bit of jealousy over Anne&#8217;s shiny new carriage. Cousin Elliott leaves Bath; and, since gold-digging birds of a feather flock together, it seems that Mrs. Clay has switched from chasing Sir Walter to chasing Cousin Elliott. Eeewwww. Despite feeling bad that she&#8217;s causing Wentworth to marry into a rather shitty family, Anne lives happily ever after with her beloved Wentworth (and a lifetime case of Wentworth Fever ;D). YAY HAPPY ENDING!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">~ THE END ~</h2>

That&#8217;s it for my epic 4-part recap of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>! Because it seems like our readers have enjoyed the series, Alix and I have decided to make it a permanent blog feature! This means I will be dissecting a classic of your choice! (Or occasionally my choice&#8230; if held up at gunpoint&#8230; KIDDING! About being held at gunpoint anyway. Err&#8230;)</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">My first official book for the <strong>Classically Challenged</strong> feature will be <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136116.The_Scarlet_Pimpernel?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em></a> by Baroness Emmuska Orczy, just in time for Diana Peterfreund&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16102412-across-a-star-swept-sea?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Across a Star-Swept Sea</em></a>, which is a retelling of the book!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">BUT! I am taking votes for my next Jane Austen read, which I may or may not try to read at the same time &#8212; I&#8217;ll assess my level of Crazy and get back to you on that later. For now, you get to decide which of these books I will be reading next for the new Classically Challenged series here on the blog. The choices were hand-picked by our resident Austenite, the lovely Alix!</h3>

<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_emma.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3903" alt="austen_emma" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_emma-194x300.jpg" width="116" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6969.Emma?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #1: <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beautiful, clever, rich &#8211; and single &#8211; Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3905 alignright" alt="austen_sensesensibility" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility-191x300.jpg" width="115" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #2: <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor&#8217;s warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of loveâand its threatened lossâthe sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_mansfieldpark.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3904" alt="austen_mansfieldpark" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_mansfieldpark-197x300.jpg" width="118" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #3: <em>Mansfield Park</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taken from the poverty of her parents&#8217; home, Fanny Price is brought up with her rich cousins at Mansfield Park, acutely aware of her humble rank and with only her cousin Edmund as an ally. When Fanny&#8217;s uncle is absent in Antigua, Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive in the neighbourhood, bringing with them London glamour and a reckless taste for flirtation. As her female cousins vie for Henry&#8217;s attention, and even Edmund falls for Mary&#8217;s dazzling charms, only Fanny remains doubtful about the Crawfords&#8217; influence and finds herself more isolated than ever.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3486" alt="banner_blognews" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png" width="106" height="106" /></a>September was another crazy month for us! October has been similar but on a more personal level. We know the blog hasn&#8217;t been as active the last couple of weeks but Paola has been sick and now has her in-laws visiting and Alix has been consumed with the realities of adulthood aka work. But! We have some awesome events and features coming up so be sure to keep an eye out for those as well as plenty of reviews. :)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, itâs #3PersonBookClub this month! Special guest <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte of Gypsy Reviews </a>will be reading and discussing the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy" target="_blank">first book in the Vampire Academy series</a> with us! All three of us have heard all kinds of things about this series and now weâre determined to find out for ourselves just what all the fuss is about. Plus, itâs the perfect season for reading about vampires. We canât wait to have our first ever #3PB with such a good friend of ours!!</p>
<blockquote><p><img class=" wp-image-3848 alignright" alt="Vampire_Academy" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vampire_Academy.jpg" width="150" height="225" />St. Vladimirâs Academy isnât just any boarding schoolâitâs a hidden place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them. Rose Hathaway is a Dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. Theyâve been on the run, but now theyâre being dragged back to St. Vladimirâsâthe very place where theyâre most in danger&#8230;</p>
<p>Rose and Lissa become enmeshed in forbidden romance, the Academyâs ruthless social scene, and unspeakable nighttime rituals. But they must be careful lest the Strigoiâthe worldâs fiercest and most dangerous vampiresâmake Lissa one of them forever.Â (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re wondering about <a href="2personbookclub-for-darkness-shows-the-stars-classics-retold" target="_blank">last month&#8217;s #2PB</a>, we read <em>For Darkness Shows the Stars</em>Â by Diana Peterfreund as part of Classics Retold! You can read all about our thoughts on this dystopian adaptation of Jane Austen&#8217;s classic novelÂ <em>Persuasion</em>!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3120" alt="banner_cantwait" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our October Wishlist</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">October is quiet month for releases that Paola is excited for (<strong>Paola&#8217;s Note:</strong> Well, I have plenty to be excited about, but I was lucky enough to get ARCs of all of them so they aren&#8217;t on my wishlist anymore haha) but it&#8217;s a whole another story for Alix! Not only is one of her all-time favourite YA series is coming to end this month but the second book in a newly favourite NA series of hers is also and the queen of romance is release the first book in her latest trilogy!</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hello again, and welcome to <strong>Part III</strong> of Paola&#8217;s translation of <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen (for the Austen-Challenged!) as part of our participation in <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a>! If you missed the other two installments of these shenanigans, here&#8217;s <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank">Part I</a> (introduction + chapters 1-7) and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank">Part II</a> (chapters 8-12).</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">PERSUASION: PART II</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapters One &amp; Two</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne finally ends her forever long stay at Uppercross with the Musgroves and departs with her old chum (and supplier of the world&#8217;s worst advice) Lady Russell. But of course it&#8217;s a small, small world so she eventually sees the Musgroves again in Lyme. It is revealed that Benwick, Prince of Emo, has been asking about Anne. Also revealed: Anne&#8217;s crybaby hypochondriac sister Mary is still a massive jerk. Another new development is Cousin Elliott&#8217;s interest in suddenly reconciling with the rest of his family after alternating between ignoring and slandering them for the past few years. He&#8217;s been sighted in Bath, being a lurking lurker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3677"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time for a new brand of misery as Anne reluctantly joins Sir Walter (King of the Douchebags) and Elizabeth (Queen of the Douchebags) at the Elliotts&#8217; townhouse in Bath. Mrs. Clay, suspected gold digger, is still living at Camden Place with them. Bath is not Anne&#8217;s favorite place in the world, so of course the rest of her awful family absolutely loves it. Sir W and Elizabeth are obsessed with Cousin Elliott, conveniently forgiving all of his past sins now that he&#8217;s dedicated to being BFFs with them again. Anne has her misgivings about Cousin Elliott as well as Mrs. Clay, not that anyone is listening. She wonders if Cousin Elliott is interested in patching things up because he&#8217;s reconsidering marrying Elizabeth. Meanwhile, our wonderful Sir Walter spends some time lamenting the general ugliness of everyone else who lives in Bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an interesting turn of events, Cousin Elliott pays a visit to Camden Place and realizes that Anne is, in fact, that cute girl he saw at the beach in Lyme not long ago. Anne is surprised to find that her first evening in Bath is less miserable than what she was expecting. Still miserable, but not AS miserable, anyway.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne continues being the only one worried about Cousin Elliott&#8217;s intentions re: Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay&#8217;s gold digging schemes re: Sir Walter. Lady Russell seems to have shelved most of her worries, although she is still of the opinion that Mrs. Clay is a shameless social climber. The more superficial and pretentious members of the Elliott clan go into full freak out mode over the impending arrival of distant relations Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, who are nobility. Relations between the Elliotts and Dalrymples have been strained since the death of Lady Elliott ages ago, but in the end the fences are mended and Anne gets to listen to her father and sister fawning over them day and night. Cousin Elliott is not as disgusted by their behavior as Anne, sneakily pointing out that at least hanging out with the Dalrymples distracts Sir Walter from any possibility of interaction (or, grossly enough, falling in love) with Mrs. Clay.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that she&#8217;s living in Bath, Anne decides to track down her former governess, Mrs. Smith. Poor Mrs. Smith is now both destitute and a cripple, but still a lovely person. Definitely better company than what Anne has to deal with at Camden Place. They have many a long talk after not seeing each other for so long. Anne admires Mrs. Smith&#8217;s ability to remain hopeful despite the tidal wave of horrible luck that destroyed her life in recent years. Of course, because Anne likes Mrs. Smith, her father and sister do not. Who didn&#8217;t see that coming?? We are treated to a rank from Sir W about his hatred of low-ranked widows and Mrs. Clay leaves the room before he can realize that he is in the presence of a low-ranked widow. /awkward</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cousin Elliott continues to express that he thinks Anne is awesome. Anne is weirded out because honestly, when does anyone ever say she&#8217;s awesome?? Or even acknowledges her presence at all?? Lady Russell believes that Cousin E may have romantic intentions towards Anne, perhaps with plans to pursue her rather than Elizabeth. She is thrilled. Anne is not. She tells Lady R as much, but leaves out the part where she obviously still suffers from Wentworth Fever like all the rest of us. (WENTWORTH I MISS YOU PLEASE COME BACK INTO THE STORY SOON)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This chapter opens with a nice, whiny letter from Mary &#8212; oh joy. That&#8217;s what you wanted to start off with, right? Appended to Mary&#8217;s usual Tales of Hypochondria and general lamentations as to how everyone else has a more awesome life than she does, we are given the news that Louisa is finally recovered and back at Uppercross&#8230; AND BENWICK IS IN LOVE WITH HER! Mary takes some time to gloat about how she was totally right that Benwick wasn&#8217;t ever interested in Anne at all; I take some time to stare at the page and then write &#8220;WHAT!!! GAMECHANGER!!!&#8221; in my notes. Aside from Mary being her usual tacky self, Anne is very pleased with the letter. She is happy for Benwick and Louisa. In place of our scheduled rant from Sir Walter, we get to hear Elizabeth say some rather uncharitable things about sailors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While on a walk through the charming streets of Bath, Anne encounters none other than Admiral Croft, now the family&#8217;s tenant at Kellynch Hall and one of her favorite people. Admiral Croft is deep in a conversation with himself in which he criticizes a painting of a ship in a shop window, which he thinks is all wrong. When he realizes that Anne is there, he invites her for a walk and they discuss the crazy news that Louisa and Benwick are now engaged. Amusingly enough, Anne is the only person in the world who thinks these two are meant to be with each other; everyone else is like WHAT!!!! GAMECHANGER!!! The topic of Louisa naturally ends up leading Admiral Croft to the related topic of Wentworth. He suggests that they invite Wentworth to visit them in Bath&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">TO BE CONTINUED</h2>

Until then, let the Wentworth Fever burn~ In the meantime, be sure to check out <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion: the movie" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-movie/" target="_blank">Alix&#8217;s post</a> on the 1995 film adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em>!</h3>
