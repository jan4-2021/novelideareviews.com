		<description><![CDATA[Thanks!

I love everyone suggestions too! I haven&#039;t read any of them but have had some on my to-read list for ever and now have added the rest too. I&#039;m especially excited to eventually read your pick since I love GRR Martin. Thanks again for participating. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh I like the black and white covers, adds to the feel!

Shutter Island was a great book, I also really enjoyed the film. And I still have only read one book by Ray Bradbury, which definitely needs correcting. Ten has been on my to-read list for a while but I still haven&#039;t gotten round to it, as has some of Marcus Sedgewick&#039;s work. And The Monk... well I bought it a while ago because it looked SO good, and it&#039;s the same story: still haven&#039;t read it! Thanks Charlene for reminding me about that one ;)

Some wonderful choices, ladies =)]]></description>
