		<description><![CDATA[I skimmed your review, since I haven&#039;t read this book yet but plan to do so really soon. It&#039;s too bad it didn&#039;t deliver on the mystery or suspense. I love it when historicals can really bring their era alive. I have mixed feelings going into this book now.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Adding real people from the not-so-distant past walks a fine line between relevant and disrespectful.&quot; You phrased that exactly right! I just always feel like it&#039;s pretty bold of an author to take liberties with real historical figures... and sometimes I feel like it&#039;s a cheap trick to make their characters or story more interesting by including someone who was interesting in real life. If that makes any sense at all &gt;&lt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the 20&#039;s setting too, it&#039;s one of my weaknesses haha. I agree, mother-daughter relationships are kind of overlooked in YA in favor of other relationships so it was nice to have at least one parent on the scene here. Nonexistent parents are kind of common in the genre, which I always find weird. Personally, my own parents were all TOO present when I was that age, haha.

Thanks Sam!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was on my June pile, but I decided to skip it in the end. I might still return to it, even if just for the 1920s setting (which I LOVE), but I&#039;ll definitely go in with lower expectations now. It&#039;s a shame that the plot didn&#039;t quite have the level of mystery and suspense you were hoping for. I&#039;m glad that the mother-daughter relationship was given some attention though, as that seems to be a rarity in YA. Lovely, helpful review, Paola! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It can be so frustrating when the reader has it all figured out and has to wait for the characters to catch up. Totally kills the suspense. I agree about the Houdini thing too. Adding real people from the not-so-distant past walks a fine line between relevant and disrespectful. It sounds like the book had some strong points too, so at least it wasn&#039;t all bad.]]></description>
