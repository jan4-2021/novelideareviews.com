<p>I was so excited to see an adaption ofÂ Jane Austen&#8217;s<em> Emma</em> that I completely missed the &#8220;<em>Latter-day</em>&#8221; double entendre in the title. Yes it is a reference to the Church of Latter-day Saints (Mormon). I think the fact that I am also from a non-religious background (and only read non-fiction based books about religion) might have played a role in my lack of recognition. Either way, I was quite surprised when I realized this connection.</p>
<p>The references to Mormonism (church attending, calling each other &#8220;Brother&#8221;, &#8220;Sister&#8221;) and probably a bunch of other things that passed over my head from my lack of knowledge about it didn&#8217;t bother me. It ended up being just part of the larger context of the story. I wasn&#8217;t into it but it didn&#8217;t turn me off the book either. What I did struggle with was towards the end of the story, after Emma creates conflict with her friends and wants to change, the book took a turn into relying heavily on religious elements (praying, following the path of Christ, God&#8217;s plan, etc). I just can&#8217;t relate to it and for me, it disconnected me completely from Emma and the story.<br />
<span id="more-2422"></span><br />
Overall the story was OK but followed the original story rather closely. While I knew to expect this since it is a modern day retelling of Austen&#8217;sÂ <em>Emma</em>, I always hope that adaptations are able to branch out and give the story more of their own twist. I just didn&#8217;t find it here. I&#8217;ll be honest here and say that I found myself bored. There just wasn&#8217;t enough happening and I found the dialogued to be long for nothing. The pacing also felt slow. This is a relatively short read but ended up feeling much longer to me unfortunately because of all of those factors. I really wished the story had found a way to surprise me more and maybe waiver from the original tale to do so.</p>
<p>I did enjoy the fact that Emma wants to be a life coach! That was a great job to give her and reality fit with the spirit of Emma&#8217;s tendency to want to medal with other people&#8217;s lives. I also like how Jane is a country singer dealing with the paparazzi! Those were by far my favourite &#8220;adaptions&#8221; of the classic characters into modern ones.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Rating: 2/5</h2>
<p>The lack of making the story it&#8217;s own was the biggest disappointment for me here. As an adaptation it was fine but nothing out of the book and personally the lack of surprises resulted in me finding myself often times bored while reading it. I personally didn&#8217;t enjoy the more &#8220;religious&#8221; aspects that came heavily into play at the end of the story and as part of the resolution of the book simply because I don&#8217;t share that belief system. If are looking for a wholesome G-rated adaption of an Austen novel or if you are a fan of books with Christian/religious beliefs, then I think you might enjoyÂ <em>Emma: A Latter-day Tale.</em></p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Beth Harbison</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Chick Lit</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley, 247 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: July 9, 2013 (St. Martin&#8217;s Press)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">10 years ago Quinn Barton was about to walk down the aisle and marry her high school sweet heart Burke. Everything she&#8217;s hoped and dream for was about to come true only to come crashing down when minutes before she was set to say &#8220;I do&#8221;, Burke&#8217;s brother Frank confirmed herÂ suspicionsÂ that Burke had cheated on her. Devastated, Quinn ran out of the church and kept running all the way to Vegas, with Frank. Quinn and Frank&#8217;s relationship lasted a blink of an eye as Quinn couldn&#8217;tÂ conceiveÂ of being with the brother of the man she thought was the love of her life and hurt her so deeply.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now 10 years later, Quinn is in a rut. She still lives in her small town and has never travelled; she now runs her family&#8217;s custom bridal gown shop and hasn&#8217;t been able to have a realÂ relationship.Â Her life is thrown once again for a loop when Burke and Frank return to town for their grandmother&#8217;s wedding. Old feelings of hurt, anger, confusion and passion arise as Quinn is forced to face the men and choices of her past in order to finally move forward in her life and be able to love again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I enjoyed the most aboutÂ <em>Chose the Wrong Guy&#8230;Â </em>was Quinn and her struggle to deal with her romantic past. I could relate and understand how the pain of losing her future lead to her being in rut. I thought it was wellÂ portrayedÂ  Quinn wasn&#8217;t self-pitying about her life, she knew full well that her life was in a rut as a consequence of avoiding her past and not dealing with her feelings. That made meÂ sympathizeÂ with her and cheer for her. I also really liked Glenn&#8217;s having Quinn doing something she wouldn&#8217;t do via his notes. Some of the them were definitely out there (and I had a hard time believe Glenn couldn&#8217;t see Day Drinking Day not turning badly!) but despite of the over-the-top-ness of it, it was a lot of fun and a great addition to the story. Oh and the chemistry between Quinn and Burke and Quinn and Frank was hot. There is one major love scene in the book and damn it was reallyÂ sizzling!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I liked the romantic leads, Burke and Frank. Neither were too dimensional. I felt like especially with Burke, we were given a good insight into why he cheated and how he&#8217;s struggled. Burke started off as the bad buy and ended up in a grey area for me. Clearly he did some thing wrong and unforgivable but it doesn&#8217;t make him a bad person. I was intrigued by Frank but was left wanting to know more about him. He is clearly an interesting character but I needed more.</p>
<p><span id="more-2419"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Which leads me to my biggest issue with the book. The book is relatively short yet it was still very slow moving. I remember hitting the 62% mark of the book and thinking &#8220;wow there isn&#8217;t much that has happened!&#8221;. A lot of time is spent either in Quinn&#8217;s inner monologue about her feeling regarding Burke and Frank or talking to Glenn and other characters about it. TheÂ inter-splicingÂ of Quinn&#8217;s daily challenges helped but wasn&#8217;t enough. I also was veryÂ disappointedÂ by the B-plot of the story: Quinn&#8217;s boutique bridal store possibly losing clientele to the new dry cleanerÂ seamstress. Here again I was left wanting more! Quinn mentions her fears about what it will mean to her business but she never does anything about it! Eventually the B-plot is easily resolved without Quinn really ever doing anything, which left me feeling as though why even bother with this story is nothing is really made out of it? It really felt like filler.Â I will also say that as someone who reads a lot of romance, I wasÂ disappointedÂ that during the major love scene there was no mention of protection. Now I know this is chick lit and they tend to not mention it as much but I find in this day in age, it&#8217;s important to mention it. It can be done with ways that don&#8217;t take you out of the scene, I have read many authors who are really good at that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">UltimatelyÂ though what bothered me the most about the book was Glenn&#8217;s attempt to make Quinn understand Burke&#8217;s cheating by arguing to her that men can have sex and it be truly mealingless, unlike women. UGH. NO. NO. NO. IÂ <em>hate</em> when this is used to reason away why a guy cheats. While I liked that Quinn stood up to Glenn and told him that there might be some men and women that can do that but Burke isn&#8217;t like that, I felt myself cringing and getting very annoyed with Glenn for saying that. I will say though the all the confrontation scenes between Quinn and Burke about his cheating were heartbreaking, in a good way. It felt brutal and honest. I would think that these kind of conversations would go that way.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall I thoughtÂ <em>Chose the Wrong Guy, Gave Him the Wrong Finger</em> was an OK book. It had elements I really like: Quinn&#8217;s struggles, Glenn&#8217;s daily challenges, and an honest and brutal conversation about cheating. Yet the slow pacing of the overall story and some choices in how the story dealt with things didn&#8217;t set well with me. I also didn&#8217;t really find there much surprise as to the resolution to the love triangle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to St.Martin&#8217;s Press for providing an ARC of this book for review via NetGalley!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fantastically funny, fresh and utterly relatable,Â <em>Brooklyn Girls</em>Â by Gemma Burgess is the first novel in her brand new series about five twenty-something friendsâPia, Angie, Julia, Coco and Madeleineâsharing a brownstone in hip, downtown Brooklyn, and discovering the ups and downs and ins and outs of their âsemi-adultâ lives. The first story belongs to sophisticated, spoiled, and stylish Pia, who finds herself completely unemployed, unemployable, and broke. So what is a recent grad with an art history degree and an unfortunate history of Facebook topless photos to do? Start a food truck business of course! Pia takes on the surprisingly cutthroat Brooklyn world of hybrid lettuce growers, artisanal yogurt makers and homemade butter producers to startÂ <em>SkinnyWheels</em>âall while dealing with hipster bees, one-night-stands, heartbreak, parental fury, wild parties, revenge, jail, loan sharks, playboys, karaoke, true love, and one adorable pink food truck. And that&#8217;s without counting her roommates&#8217; problems, too. (taken from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16049612-beginner-s-luck">Goodreads</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another New Adult novel! I&#8217;m excited to see the genre growing!Â <em>Brooklyn GirlsÂ </em>(which I believe is now being published under the name <em>Beginner&#8217;s Luck: A Brooklyn Girls Novel</em>) is the first a 5 part series of novels featuring anÂ eclecticÂ group of young twenty-something women living together in Brooklyn. I really liked the premise of the book. It&#8217;s refreshing to see books that center more around finding yourself then a love story.</p>
<p><span id="more-2414"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pia is anÂ endearing leadÂ character who grew on me through out. At first I&#8217;ll admit to not really liking her. She suffered a littleÂ <em>too</em> much from the &#8220;poor rich girl&#8221; syndrom. Pia is pretty and rich yet still the queen of self-pity. I was rolling my eyes really hard at her having to party and beingÂ <em>soooooo</em> traumatized by her first boyfriend dumping her when she was 18. I get that first heartbreaks are hard, but I found her reaction to it to be over-the-top and self pitying. Luckily, I was able to get past this once the story moved towards Pia finding a path for herself. I found her struggle to get a first job to be very relatable. It is true that nowadays companies want to hire people who have experience but when you fresh out of college without experience, it&#8217;s impossible to get hired cause no one wants to take a risk on you for you to be able to get the experience you need to get a job! It&#8217;s a truly vicious cycle. The stronger Pia who decides to take charge of her future, following her parent&#8217;s ultimatum of her either getting her life together or moving back to Zurich, was terrific! I liked how the story didn&#8217;t make her ambition of running a successful food truck easy.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I really loved the most aboutÂ <em>Brooklyn GirlsÂ </em>is that this isn&#8217;t a book about love. Yes Pia has a love interest and loveÂ entanglementsÂ but they really are secondary to the main focus of it: finding a place for yourself on your own after college and the importance of friendship. That being said, IÂ <em>didÂ </em>enjoy the romance. I was actually surprised by it! I&#8217;m usually easily spot which guy the girl will chose, but I was happily wrong this time! Anyway, sidetrack! The friendship between Pia, Julia, Angie, Coco and Madeleine is really what made the book for me. These girls, whether they are long time BFFS or barely able to tolerate each other, have each other back. Yes there was some of the bitchinessÂ girls are infamous for but none that I consider beingÂ overlyÂ exaggerated. I think the book did an excellent job at showing female friendship in it&#8217;s various forms and the importance of women sticking together and being united. Seriously, it made me so happy to not have to deal with so many of the usual clichÃ©d girl friendship tropes! I wish more books followed this example.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall the story had me eye rolling a lot more then I would have liked. There&#8217;s a definite sense of priveledge to all these girls that I simply couldn&#8217;t sympathize with. While there was a lot of the clichÃ©d &#8220;<em>poor little rich</em>Â girls&#8221;-ism in the book,Â I was able to get over that for the most part but it definitely irked me throughout. I understand that rich people have struggles (God knows I hate theÂ tropeÂ of theÂ literallyÂ poor little girl who can&#8217;t find love and needs to prove herself as much when it&#8217;s the poor little rich girl), I just wish more authors would take a risk and do something different with characters with aÂ privilegedÂ background! Still, theÂ strengthÂ of the friendship and the positiveÂ portrayalÂ of it and Pia&#8217;s character growth was very enjoyable and made me happy I picked up this book and read it!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I definitely recommendÂ <em>Brooklyn Girls</em>Â especiallyÂ with summer kickstarting (beach book alert!). I&#8217;ll be picking up the next book in the series when it comes out, which will feature Angie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to St.Martin&#8217;s Press for providing an ARC of this book!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 376 Pages (2004)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pursuit of perfection is something Macy knows by heart. She strives to be the perfect student, the perfect girlfriend, the perfect daughter, to the point that she can barely remember who the real girl is underneath. Deep inside, the real Macy is weighted with guilt and regret, still grieving in the wake of her father&#8217;s death and feeling disconnected from everyone and everything. But this is the summer when Macy will learn to let go &#8212; to be her true self, and to live fearlessly, despite how unpredictable and imperfect life can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So! This was my first ever Sarah Dessen book, recommended to me by the lovely Ana at <a href="http://t.co/cQarM2mD3s" target="_blank"><em>Anahera Reads</em></a> when I was looking around for a good YA Contemporary for this event. I have to admit that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to try this author&#8217;s books for YEARS. I came in half expecting something insubstantial and/or hormonal to the extreme, but my perceptions were completely changed by the time I turned the last page. Well, long before that, actually. The fact that I loved this book so much is kind of crazy, because I am definitely not a big contemporary reader, and definitely not in the YA genre. I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I find it hard to enjoy contemporary books because they just don&#8217;t seem like enough of an escape for me, but I am now making an exception for Sarah Dessen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; Actually, this book kind of sent me on a crazy Dessen binge. I HAVE NO REGRETS. <em>The Truth About Forever</em> surprised me with its candid look at grief, the vibrance and believability of its characters, and the small, poignant moments that I still haven&#8217;t forgotten even weeks after reading it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2243"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love this book for its realistic take on what being a teenager is like. Since I read a lot of YA, the average age range is anywhere between 15-19 years old, and not every book has a believable take on being that age. Maybe my own experience with being in high school was the most grossly unexciting thing ever, but sometimes I run into teenaged characters who do things or live these lifestyles that seem so farfetched. Macy, however, is someone you can easily accept as being 17 years old, in that final summer before senior year and dealing with issues that are both relevant and understandable. Grief is such a powerful force, and it has shaped the way she&#8217;s been living her life. She was a character I sympathized with, but also a character I wanted to hug REALLY HARD. I liked her immediately. And I was thrilled to see that the teenagers in this book weren&#8217;t living this constant dramafest 24/7, with hookups and breakups and some new *disaster* every 5 minutes. They were just ordinary people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I think it would be pretty accurate to say that it&#8217;s the art of finding meaning in the ordinary and the everyday that makes Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing so easy to enjoy and identify with. I&#8217;m figuring that out with every Dessen book I read. Her stories are warm and inviting, but not superficial in any way. And the thing is, even though reading this book was a lot like watching a feel-good movie, and even though some things were predictable in the way feel-good movies usually are, I didn&#8217;t care. I liked it anyway. It was comforting, a lot like sitting down at Starbucks with an old friend and just talking for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Wes. I <em>loved</em> Wes. I loved the entire cast, really. Minus Jason, but you aren&#8217;t really supposed to love him, and I mostly felt sorry for the guy. The book is full of people you can&#8217;t help liking. They&#8217;re funny, memorable, and have really distinct personalities. Their interactions and relationships with one another were so natural. The writer has a gift for creating characters you could easily picture living next door, waving to you from their driveway, and she even makes you wish you could really wave back.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Truth About Forever</em> is the story of one summer, with all its small joys and sorrows. It&#8217;s the little things that all add up to a bigger picture, for Macy and for the reader. It made me smile, but it also made me think, and because of that I decided I was okay with the story being a bit predictable. After all, there&#8217;s something about knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going and how to get there, and sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a book hold your hand and make you feel like you&#8217;re home. I highly recommend it, and Sarah Dessen in general, whether you&#8217;re a big fan of contemporary or a stranger to it like I was.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Joe Piazza</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Chick Lit</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley, 147 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: June 4, 2013 (Open Road Integrated Media)</p>
<p>Best friends Sophie and Annie have each hit rock bottom for different reasons. After being broken up with by her long-term boyfriend (and for his floozy secretary none-the-less!), Sophie has spiraled into stalker like behaviour: emailing, texting and following her ex and his new flame. She flees her New York CityÂ apartmentÂ for the sanctuary of the house she inherited from her Grandmother in her hometown in New Jersey. Her BBF Annie&#8217;s rock bottom is a little different: the owner of the town&#8217;s best (and only) bar, Annie enjoys drinking a littleÂ <em>tooÂ </em>much and finds herself in trouble with the law after a night of drinking, driving and public disorder. Annie is sentenced to court mandated alcoholÂ treatment and brings Sophie along for &#8220;support&#8221; to her first AA meeting. After the meeting, Sophie has a revelation: she should start a Love Addicts Anonymous group for other women like her in hopes of helping them and herself find closure and a better love life. With the help of Joe, Annie&#8217;sÂ good-lookingÂ AA counselor, Sophie set ups her group and finds friendship and support with a rag tag group of women from all different walks of life, all trying to figure out what went wrong in their love lives.</p>
<p><em>Love Rehab: A Novel in Twelve Steps</em>Â is your classic chick lit novel (which is my books is by no means a bad thing!): it has a funny, smart and a little bit broken heroine, a cute guy, an awesome best friend, chuckle worth dialogue and a relatable story. The premise of the story is one that is quite common: boy dumps girl, girl goes crazy, girl finds herself, girl moves on; but I enjoyed the approachÂ <em>Love Rehab</em> took with it. My favourite parts of the book where when certainÂ behavioursÂ and expectations were called out because let&#8217;s be honest, I think most woman have done something like that (ok maybe not posting nude pics of an ex but definitely looking up an his/her current GF on Facebook!). I also really liked how the book called out shows likeÂ <em>The Bachelor</em> (disguised as a show calledÂ <em>The Husband</em> here) and romantic comedies for given women unrealistic expectations. Who can&#8217;t related to that?!<br />
<span id="more-2020"></span><br />
I found Sophie to be a sympathetic main character. I could related to her and what she was going through. I really enjoyed seeing her work through getting over her ex and coming to terms with her love addiction and resulting behaviour. Her &#8220;ah ha!&#8221; moments had be going &#8220;yes!&#8221; in agreement and it felt like a natural progression for her, her change didn&#8217;t come out of the blue.</p>
<p>Where I found the book lacking was with the other secondary characters: not much is said or explored about the other woman in LAA. Even Sophie, who is given somewhat of a backstory at the start, is veryÂ developedÂ  This book is short and unfortunately this is one of the consequences of that but part of me wishes still wishes that maybe the story only had 1 or 2 extra characters, such as Sophie and Prithi or Princess or Stella, and focused more on those women then having a whole group of them we were constantly jumping between.</p>
<p>The ending of the story was very neat andÂ tidy, which again usually goes with the territory of chick lit, but in this case I was hoping for a little more. Everything being wrapped nicely felt a little too unrealistic to me and going against what the rest of the book was &#8220;preaching&#8221;. Â Of course I was rooting for these women to find peace and new love, especially our heroine Sophie but again, I wish her ending and the grand gesture done by Joe, would have been a little lessÂ <em>perfect</em> especially since the book sets up at the start that love isn&#8217;t like a romantic comedy and yet that what itÂ ultimatelyÂ delivers the reader.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall I really enjoyedÂ <em>Love Rehab</em>! It doesn&#8217;t break the genre mould but I still felt like it was a refreshing approach to this kind of story and a fun read. It&#8217;s the kind of book you can load onto your e-reader and spend a pleasant afternoon (at most, again this book is a short read!) reading on the beach or in a park and with summer right around the corner it&#8217;s perfect timing!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to Open Road Integrated MediaÂ and NetGalley for the providing us with an ARC for review! You can pick up <em>Love Rehab: A Novel in Twelve Steps</em>Â as of June 4th!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Lauren Graham</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fiction/Chick Lit</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC, 352 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE:</strong> April 30th 2013, Ballantine Books</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Franny Banks gave herself 3 years to make it in New York as an actress. Itâs now 6 months before her deadline and sheâs nowhere near having âmade it.â With that deadline looming over her, Franny starts doubting herself â until unexpected turns and encounters lead her down a path of discovery and revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I, just like many others, picked up this book because I am a fan of Lauren Graham (star of <em>Gilmore Girls</em> and <em>Parenthood</em>). I was hesitant, worrying that this book might disappoint and be another case of actors thinking they are writers. Fortunately, Someday, Someday, Maybe is a well written, smart, and funny book that didnât disappoint after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dialogue has the same kind of fast paced, snarky witticism that Graham has become famous for delivering on-screen. I think she infused a lot of herself and what was probably her own personal experience as an up-and-coming actress into the character of Franny. I liked the surrounding cast of characters, although I wish we had spent more time learning more about them. Both Jane (Frannyâs best friend) and Dan (their roommate) were interesting characters but I was left wanting more background. We do get more insight into Dan, but Jane remains a superficial, peripheral character. I thought the story was a fairly realistic portrayal of what itâs like to be a struggling actress. Franny struggles both financially and emotionally throughout and it never feels overdone for the sake of either pitying her or playing up the clichÃ©s of being a âwaitress/actress.â The overall story was smart, heartwarming and funny, but predictable. Nothing happens in the storyâs development that came to me as a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That being said, it was written well enough that I still enjoyed seeing Franny go through the experience. My favourite twist happened in the end, and it was the only part of the story I actually wasnât able to predict. The book ends on a fairly abrupt note that can be interpreted as ambiguous. Personally, I found the ending to be very appropriate and it gave me closure on this chapter of Frannyâs life. I can, however, see how some readers might be left wanting more, especially since 2 key points of the story arenât clearly concluded.</p>
<p><span id="more-1549"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite features of the book was the inclusion of some pages of Frannyâs Filofax and various call sheets and script pages. It made me feel more connected to her. My biggest issue: the book is written in first person narrative. I find that this writing style makes it harder for me to get a sense of the full story because you are âstuckâ in the brain of your lead character.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a fan of Lauren Graham or looking for a good, easy, yet touching read, I think this book is for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you NetGalley and Ballantine Books for the chance to read and review this book before release!</p>
