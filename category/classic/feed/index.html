<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ack!! Sorry for the delay on this!! I&#8217;ve had a crazy week (and a half&#8230;?) since the last installment of this recap &#8212; first I caught the worst cold I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, then I was subsequently slammed with work and endless amounts of Grown-Up Responsibilities that ended up leaving no time at all for blogging. *sobs* Anyway, here is the fourth and final post in my Persuasion recap! If you missed the previous installments, here they are: <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank"><strong>Part I (Intro &amp; Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>, <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank"><strong>Part II (Chapters 8-12)</strong></a>, and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 3" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-3/" target="_blank"><strong>Part III (Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a> may be over, but Alix and I have decided that my <del>shenanigans</del> recaps will carry on as a feature on the blog! (This is the part where everyone runs away screaming.) So, at the end of this post I&#8217;m giving you a chance to tell me <strong>which Austen classic I should recap next</strong>! Please remember that with this great power comes great responsibility, et al etc.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></span>: This is the grand finale of <em>Persuasion</em>, so brace yourself for ALL THE FEELS!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter Seven</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh snap! Mrs. Clay, are you now gunning for Cousin Elliott instead of Sir Walter??! You gold-digging minx, you! Not that this worked since Cousin E decided to go walking in the rain with Anne. Which, of course, is when Wentworth finally decides to come back into our story! (A wild Wentworth appears! SNORT) After seeing this other dude taking walks in the rain with Anne, Wentworth decides that he ALSO wants to do this. Plus he wants to show off his shiny new umbrella. But Cousin E interrupts the conversation, and a stroll with Anne is not in the cards for Wentworth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the days pass, Wentworth sightings continue to take place all around Bath. Even Lady Russell takes some time to stare at him. She covers this up by pretending to be staring at some really snazzy drawing room curtains instead. Smooth, Lady R. Anne says nothing about this but does make some private commentary on &#8220;the elegant stupidity of private parties.&#8221; Because she&#8217;s Anne, and sometimes snarky, even if she doesn&#8217;t ever say these things out loud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the chapter, everyone is in full freak-out mode over an upcoming concert. Anne doesn&#8217;t really want to go&#8230; until she realizes that Wentworth might be there. #Gamechanger</p>
<p><span id="more-3678"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Wentworth does indeed attend the concert. He and Anne have a brief chat about Benwick and Louisa&#8217;s surprise engagement, during which Wentworth expresses his own concerns that the two aren&#8217;t alike enough. He can&#8217;t believe how easily Benwick got over his fiancee, the tragic Fanny Harville; &#8220;A man does not recover from such devotion of the heart to such a woman!&#8221; OH REALLY???? HMMMMMMMMMM</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, Wentworth adds that he does feel responsible for what happened to Louisa. Anne makes some sympathetic noises but mostly just shrugs and is like, &#8220;Ah, well, but I do hope I get to go back to Lyme someday cause that place was awesome. Just saying.&#8221; This is because she&#8217;s secretly rendered incoherent by Wentworth&#8217;s mini-speech about never being able to get over certain women one falls in love with. Is there hope in this awkward, angsty situation after all??!!! Except before any more of this riveting conversation can continue, Cousin Elliott appears on the scene and proceeds to go through with THE MOST UNWANTED INTERRUPTION OF ALL TIME. SERIOUSLY, DUDE?????</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dismayed Anne watches Wentworth return to his own seat while Cousin Elliott starts confessing that he&#8217;s heard all sorts of lovely things about Anne and that he thinks very highly of her AND ALSO BTW I&#8217;M GOING TO SORT OF PROPOSE TO YOU NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONCERT. (Yes, this happened.) Anne rendered speechless; resolves to flee ASAP. After intermission, she makes up her mind to go sit next to Wentworth and all the readers in the world stand up and just cheer for hours on end UNTIL COUSIN ELLIOTT COMES BACK TO RUIN THE MOMENT AGAIN DAMNIT GO AWAY JSKDHFKJSDHF</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SDHFFHJSGDFHJSFKJHDJKFH</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the days following the concert, Anne devotes all her energy to avoiding Cousin Elliott like the plague. She decides to visit her old friend Mrs. Smith, her former governess, who (if you remember from last installment) is now a destitute cripple but still a very sweet lady. She figures no one in her family, including Cousin E, would be caught dead consorting with destitute, crippled widows and that Mrs. Smith&#8217;s house is the safest place to hide right now. But when she gets there, Mrs. Smith starts being super weird about the whole Cousin E thing, going so far as to tell Anne that she expected to hear news of an engagement that day, and that she thinks Cousin E is a great guy, et al etc. Anne is confused and chooses to investigate further, whereupon Mrs. Smith suddenly pulls a complete 180 and condemns Cousin E as a Grade A Douchebag&#8230; what is going on??!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a considerable amount of hemming and hawing, Mrs Smith divulges that she has known Cousin E for quite some time. In fact, he used to be a very close friend of hers through her late husband, back when Cousin E was much less monetarily endowed and would come hang out with them/mooch off their food and hospitality all the time. Apparently he married his first wife (now also deceased) for her money rather than marrying Anne&#8217;s sister Elizabeth way back when. Mrs Smith produces an incriminating letter that proves what a lying, scheming, gold digging brigand Cousin Elliott really is. Behold, a list of his dastardly crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisted in ruining the Smith family finances, eventually leading to the demise of Mr. Smith and leaving Mrs. Smith a destitute, crippled widow.</li>
<li>Was the executor of Mr. Smith&#8217;s will, and yet refuses to assist Mrs. Smith in claiming property and money that is due to her and which might just reverse her fortunes.</li>
<li>Decided to re-insinuate himself in the Elliott family&#8217;s good graces when he realized that Mrs. Clay, that (fellow) conniving, gold-digging minx, had plans to try and marry Sir Walter. And lady, this town ain&#8217;t big enough for the both of us. /cue gunfight in Austen novel</li>
<li>Is now planning to foil Mrs. Clay&#8217;s marriage prospects AND marry Anne himself&#8230;!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After listening to all this, Anne realizes just how close she came to being persuaded YET AGAIN to make the wrong decision. If she&#8217;d listened to Lady Russell&#8217;s babbling about how awesome it would be to marry Cousin Elliott and become mistress of Kellynch Hall just like her mother used to be, Anne would be in the same capsizing ship all over again. She resolves to tell Lady R everything she&#8217;s just learned about the true depths of Cousin E&#8217;s utter douchebaggery.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a true professional Queen Douchebag, Elizabeth manages to &#8220;send her love&#8221; to Lady Russell while simultaneously putting down her taste in books and ridiculing her fashion sense. Hey, this kind of jackass behavior takes skill, okay? Speaking of jackasses, Sir Walter tacks on HIS love to Lady Russell while also criticizing how disheveled she looks in the morning. Ah, the apple doesn&#8217;t fall far from the tree~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With perfect timing, another bad apple rolls into town &#8212; none other than our favorite crybaby hypochondriac, Mary! Right behind her are a bunch of the Musgroves visiting from Uppercross. Anne&#8217;s visit to Lady R is put off as she is pulled into social calls with the Musgroves and learns all about the upcoming weddings planned for Louisa and Henrietta. She is genuinely happy for both of the girls and mostly enjoys seeing everyone again (minus Mary, cause who would really want to see her??) but of course Wentworth soon arrives to have dinner with them all and brings a whole lot of Awkward with him. Anne and Wentworth are careful to stand on opposite sides of the room while secretly wrestling with inner turmoil. Mary, renowned busybody, happens to glance out the window and see some sort of furtive exchange going on between Mrs Clay and Cousin Elliott out on the street. This gets everyone talking about Anne and Cousin E; Anne is consequently upset that all of Bath seems to think she&#8217;s marrying that punk. Eeewwwwww.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the pleasure of watching Mary and her husband have another of their fun little marital squabbles, Sir William and Elizabeth crash the party in order to invite everyone to THEIR party on the following night. Because, appropriate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the following day, Anne is hanging out at the hotel with the visitors from Uppercross. Mrs. Musgrove and Mrs. Croft (wife of Admiral Croft, tenant at the Elliott family&#8217;s estate, Kellynch Hall) are avidly discussing short engagements versus long engagements and seem to favor the latter option. Long engagements are apparently the worst idea ever. Wentworth pretends he isn&#8217;t listening. Pffftttt WHATEVER, WENTWORTH. Captain Harville (seafaring friend of Wentworth) randomly starts talking to Anne about his late sister Fanny, who was engaged to Benwick. He shows Anne a portrait of Benwick that had been commissioned for Fanny, but which is now being made over for Benwick&#8217;s new fiancee Louisa Musgrove. He laments that Fanny would not have &#8220;forgotten&#8221; Benwick as quickly as Benwick forgot about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne agrees, and in her BEST speech ever in the whole book, she makes a fantastic argument basically stating that women do not forget love as easily as men do. Wentworth continues to pretend that he isn&#8217;t listening&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BUT THEN HE PASSES HER A NOTE (MIDDLE SCHOOL STYLE) AND IT IS THE BEST NOTE EVER AND JUST EEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKK KJDHFKSJDHFKJSDHFKJSDFHKJSDHF THIS IS THE SOUND OF ME DYING OF THE FEELS</strong></h3>
<p>(in my notes this moment is marked by me writing the word <strong>EEEEEKKKKKKK</strong> in gigantic all-caps letters that take up like 5 lines)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>***Pause for customary moment of unabashed flailing after being facepunched by feels***</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WENTWORTH AND ANNE RENEW THEIR ENGAGEMENT. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sir Walter finally writes this down in his precious book of the British Peerage (LOL). Lady Russell is made to writhe in agony as her long-ago prediction of doom and misfortune is proven COMPLETELY WRONG. Ha!!! Mary, of course, decides to take all the credit for her sister&#8217;s match with Wentworth but also suffers quite a bit of jealousy over Anne&#8217;s shiny new carriage. Cousin Elliott leaves Bath; and, since gold-digging birds of a feather flock together, it seems that Mrs. Clay has switched from chasing Sir Walter to chasing Cousin Elliott. Eeewwww. Despite feeling bad that she&#8217;s causing Wentworth to marry into a rather shitty family, Anne lives happily ever after with her beloved Wentworth (and a lifetime case of Wentworth Fever ;D). YAY HAPPY ENDING!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">~ THE END ~</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>Okay, people! That&#8217;s it for my epic 4-part recap of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>! Because it seems like our readers have enjoyed the series, Alix and I have decided to make it a permanent blog feature! This means I will be dissecting a classic of your choice! (Or occasionally my choice&#8230; if held up at gunpoint&#8230; KIDDING! About being held at gunpoint anyway. Err&#8230;)</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beautiful, clever, rich &#8211; and single &#8211; Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3905 alignright" alt="austen_sensesensibility" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility-191x300.jpg" width="115" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #2: <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor&#8217;s warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of loveâand its threatened lossâthe sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_mansfieldpark.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3904" alt="austen_mansfieldpark" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_mansfieldpark-197x300.jpg" width="118" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #3: <em>Mansfield Park</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taken from the poverty of her parents&#8217; home, Fanny Price is brought up with her rich cousins at Mansfield Park, acutely aware of her humble rank and with only her cousin Edmund as an ally. When Fanny&#8217;s uncle is absent in Antigua, Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive in the neighbourhood, bringing with them London glamour and a reckless taste for flirtation. As her female cousins vie for Henry&#8217;s attention, and even Edmund falls for Mary&#8217;s dazzling charms, only Fanny remains doubtful about the Crawfords&#8217; influence and finds herself more isolated than ever.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hello again, and welcome to <strong>Part III</strong> of Paola&#8217;s translation of <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen (for the Austen-Challenged!) as part of our participation in <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a>! If you missed the other two installments of these shenanigans, here&#8217;s <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank">Part I</a> (introduction + chapters 1-7) and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank">Part II</a> (chapters 8-12).</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">PERSUASION: PART II</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapters One &amp; Two</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne finally ends her forever long stay at Uppercross with the Musgroves and departs with her old chum (and supplier of the world&#8217;s worst advice) Lady Russell. But of course it&#8217;s a small, small world so she eventually sees the Musgroves again in Lyme. It is revealed that Benwick, Prince of Emo, has been asking about Anne. Also revealed: Anne&#8217;s crybaby hypochondriac sister Mary is still a massive jerk. Another new development is Cousin Elliott&#8217;s interest in suddenly reconciling with the rest of his family after alternating between ignoring and slandering them for the past few years. He&#8217;s been sighted in Bath, being a lurking lurker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3677"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time for a new brand of misery as Anne reluctantly joins Sir Walter (King of the Douchebags) and Elizabeth (Queen of the Douchebags) at the Elliotts&#8217; townhouse in Bath. Mrs. Clay, suspected gold digger, is still living at Camden Place with them. Bath is not Anne&#8217;s favorite place in the world, so of course the rest of her awful family absolutely loves it. Sir W and Elizabeth are obsessed with Cousin Elliott, conveniently forgiving all of his past sins now that he&#8217;s dedicated to being BFFs with them again. Anne has her misgivings about Cousin Elliott as well as Mrs. Clay, not that anyone is listening. She wonders if Cousin Elliott is interested in patching things up because he&#8217;s reconsidering marrying Elizabeth. Meanwhile, our wonderful Sir Walter spends some time lamenting the general ugliness of everyone else who lives in Bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an interesting turn of events, Cousin Elliott pays a visit to Camden Place and realizes that Anne is, in fact, that cute girl he saw at the beach in Lyme not long ago. Anne is surprised to find that her first evening in Bath is less miserable than what she was expecting. Still miserable, but not AS miserable, anyway.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne continues being the only one worried about Cousin Elliott&#8217;s intentions re: Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay&#8217;s gold digging schemes re: Sir Walter. Lady Russell seems to have shelved most of her worries, although she is still of the opinion that Mrs. Clay is a shameless social climber. The more superficial and pretentious members of the Elliott clan go into full freak out mode over the impending arrival of distant relations Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, who are nobility. Relations between the Elliotts and Dalrymples have been strained since the death of Lady Elliott ages ago, but in the end the fences are mended and Anne gets to listen to her father and sister fawning over them day and night. Cousin Elliott is not as disgusted by their behavior as Anne, sneakily pointing out that at least hanging out with the Dalrymples distracts Sir Walter from any possibility of interaction (or, grossly enough, falling in love) with Mrs. Clay.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that she&#8217;s living in Bath, Anne decides to track down her former governess, Mrs. Smith. Poor Mrs. Smith is now both destitute and a cripple, but still a lovely person. Definitely better company than what Anne has to deal with at Camden Place. They have many a long talk after not seeing each other for so long. Anne admires Mrs. Smith&#8217;s ability to remain hopeful despite the tidal wave of horrible luck that destroyed her life in recent years. Of course, because Anne likes Mrs. Smith, her father and sister do not. Who didn&#8217;t see that coming?? We are treated to a rank from Sir W about his hatred of low-ranked widows and Mrs. Clay leaves the room before he can realize that he is in the presence of a low-ranked widow. /awkward</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cousin Elliott continues to express that he thinks Anne is awesome. Anne is weirded out because honestly, when does anyone ever say she&#8217;s awesome?? Or even acknowledges her presence at all?? Lady Russell believes that Cousin E may have romantic intentions towards Anne, perhaps with plans to pursue her rather than Elizabeth. She is thrilled. Anne is not. She tells Lady R as much, but leaves out the part where she obviously still suffers from Wentworth Fever like all the rest of us. (WENTWORTH I MISS YOU PLEASE COME BACK INTO THE STORY SOON)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This chapter opens with a nice, whiny letter from Mary &#8212; oh joy. That&#8217;s what you wanted to start off with, right? Appended to Mary&#8217;s usual Tales of Hypochondria and general lamentations as to how everyone else has a more awesome life than she does, we are given the news that Louisa is finally recovered and back at Uppercross&#8230; AND BENWICK IS IN LOVE WITH HER! Mary takes some time to gloat about how she was totally right that Benwick wasn&#8217;t ever interested in Anne at all; I take some time to stare at the page and then write &#8220;WHAT!!! GAMECHANGER!!!&#8221; in my notes. Aside from Mary being her usual tacky self, Anne is very pleased with the letter. She is happy for Benwick and Louisa. In place of our scheduled rant from Sir Walter, we get to hear Elizabeth say some rather uncharitable things about sailors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While on a walk through the charming streets of Bath, Anne encounters none other than Admiral Croft, now the family&#8217;s tenant at Kellynch Hall and one of her favorite people. Admiral Croft is deep in a conversation with himself in which he criticizes a painting of a ship in a shop window, which he thinks is all wrong. When he realizes that Anne is there, he invites her for a walk and they discuss the crazy news that Louisa and Benwick are now engaged. Amusingly enough, Anne is the only person in the world who thinks these two are meant to be with each other; everyone else is like WHAT!!!! GAMECHANGER!!! The topic of Louisa naturally ends up leading Admiral Croft to the related topic of Wentworth. He suggests that they invite Wentworth to visit them in Bath&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">TO BE CONTINUED</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The final installment of my epic <em>Persuasion</em> recap will be posted tomorrow! Until then, let the Wentworth Fever burn~ In the meantime, be sure to check out <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion: the movie" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-movie/" target="_blank">Alix&#8217;s post</a> on the 1995 film adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em>!</h3>

<h4 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5dcead04-abde-61c1-304d-b760d53a0bac" style="text-align: left;">Please excuse us while A Novel Idea takes a little break from talking about books to talk about&#8230; a movie!Â <em>I know!</em></h4>
<p>There are probably as many movie/TV adaptions of Jane Austen&#8217;s works as their are book adaptions. And I have <s>all</s> 99% of them as any true Austenite has (yes I have even see the Bollywood adaption of P&amp;P but that&#8217;s a story for another time). The BBC has been my Austen dealer since I was a teen and they continued to feed my addiction a few years ago when they readapted most of Austen&#8217;s works including <em>Persuasion</em>! Now there is a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114117/" target="_blank">1995 adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em></a> that is good. But the thing is, Wentworth is not attractive (yes I am <em>that</em> superficial but how can I not be after they gave us Colin Firth jumping into a lake!). Luckily 2007 came around and the BBC gave me us adaption starring the <em>very</em> handsome Rupert Penry-Jones!</p>
<p>Whether you are an Austenite or have no interest in ever reading her books, I still think you should check out this adaption of Persuasion. Aside from the fact that it&#8217;s adapted from a literary work, Persuasion is a great story. Still not convinced? Intrigued?? Just curious why I love it so much??? Well good news!</p>
<p>Here are my reasons why you MUST watch the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844330/" target="_blank">2007 adaption of <em>Persuasion</em></a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-6.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3819 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-6" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-6.jpg" width="200" height="282" /></a></p>
<p>The story is actually very well adapted. Sure lots of stuff it cut out but this version clocks in at 90 minutes so it&#8217;s normal. If you aren&#8217;t super familiar or at all familiar with the story, you will never be able to tell!</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3820 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-7" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-7.jpg" width="200" height="133" /></a><br />
WENTWORTH IS HOT. LIKE SERIOUSLY VERY, VERY HOT. Yes I am that superficial. No I don&#8217;t care. LOOK AT THAT FACE! Sure I pictured Wentworth with dark hair BUT WHATEVER.Â Rupert Penry-Jones is PERFECT as Wentworth. Not only he is super good looking but he&#8217;s great Wentworth too! He&#8217;s able to capture the him perfectly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3818" alt="persuasion2007-5" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-5.jpg" width="200" height="112" /></a></p>
<p>Anne and Wentworth&#8217;s love story is truly beautiful. These actors have crazy chemistry and combined that with a story where you just can&#8217;t help but cheer on the guy and the girl getting back together makes for a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours. You feel Anne&#8217;s regret at letting herself have been persuaded by her family and friends to reject Wentworth, and you understand why Wentworth is cool towards her (oh dudes and their fragile egos). You cannot but help but cheer for these two crazies kids to get their issues resolved and make out.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-1.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3814 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-1" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-1.jpg" width="200" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">OH THE ANGST!Â <em>PersuasionÂ </em>is full of angst: from Anne over Wentworth and his possible engagement to another woman, to Wentworth still being bitter about Anne&#8217;s rejection, I think Austen might have called itÂ <em>Angst</em>Â (if that word had existed in the 19th century. You get plenty of<em>Â those looks</em>: Anne sneaking a glance at Wentworth (I lost track of the number of times they have those looks!), Wentworth sneaking a glance at Anne, Anne&#8217;s inner monologue about being &#8220;over him&#8221; and crying over the past of her diary. If you like angst, this delivers x 100.</p>
<p><span id="more-3525"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3817 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-4" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-4.jpg" width="200" height="113" /></a></p>
<p>Anne is exactly how I would picture her. She isn&#8217;t a beauty but she has a handsomeness about her. She&#8217;s also looks the right age and is portrayed in the truest manner of how Austen created her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-3.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3816 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-3" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-3.jpg" width="200" height="150" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Elliot Clan is perfectly cast and insufferable in the best way. Oh and why yes, that is Anthony Head aka Giles as the condescending douche back known as Sir Walter! But seriously, from Mary the annoying hypochondriac and Elizabeth who&#8217;s face just says &#8220;bitch&#8221;, Anne family is is spot on and I loved hating them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-8.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3821 aligncenter" alt="persuasion2007-8" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/persuasion2007-8.jpg" width="200" height="134" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The sceneries are too die for! Seriously this movie isÂ <em>gorgeous!</em> If you&#8217;re a fan of beautiful country settings, lovely period costumes and anything English, thenÂ <em>PersuasionÂ </em>is for you!</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Why hello there! This is Part II of my (shenanigan-ized) chapter-by-chapter recap of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>, specifically designed with the Austen-Challenged in mind. For a complete breakdown of the important faces and places, as well as the first seven chapters, <strong><a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/">head over here to Part I</a></strong>!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-4149-aa55-843e-d0dd63d1b44d" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because there is no justice in the world, Anne is now forced to hang out with Wentworth ALL THE DAMN TIME. The Musgroves all have Wentworth Fever and are constantly inventing new dinner parties, impromptu musical performances, and other crackpot schemes to invite him over. For Anne, itâs horrible suddenly being strangers when they used to be so close. The topic of the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son Richard is brought up; he was deemed inherently useless while still alive, but magically became awesome upon dying tragically young. Wentworth was his captain at sea and gets stuck listening to Mrs. Musgrove talking about how wonderful Richard was. He seems unconvinced of this, but only Anne notices. She continues to endure while Wentworth gives her the coldest cold shoulder ever in the history of cold shoulders.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: Wentworth is the biggest grudge holder ever. True story)</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-3674"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A cousin of the Musgroves, Charles Hayter, returns to Uppercross only to discover that he is no longer the object of everyoneâs affections. Wentworth Fever <b>(AN: trademark)Â </b>rages on. Cousin Charles is rather upset by this turn of events, since he pretty much had an arrangement with Henrietta Musgrove that they would eventually marry and live happily ever after. This might still happen if anyone could get her to stop clinging to Wentworth for at least two seconds. Alas, Cousin Charles seems doomed to being ruthlessly friendzoned <strong>(AN: LOL Austen would have totally used that term had it existed back then)Â </strong>for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, Anne suffers in silence as Mary and her husband (you know, the OTHER Charles) <strong>(AN: not confusing at all)Â </strong>strike up lively discussions on which of the Misses Musgrove will end up marrying Wentworth. Mary is a horrible person and doesnât notice that this topic makes Anne want to hurl herself off the nearest cliff. And then, on a random visit, Wentworth witnesses Anne being plagued by one of her horrible nephews and handles it LIKE A BOSS. Anne marvels at his ability to wrangle disobedient children while simultaneously wondering if this /means/ anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The crazy love quadrangle between Wentworth, the Misses Musgrove, and Cousin Charles gets more intense every day. Anne, reluctant spectator, doesnât think that Wentworth is truly in love with either of the women. But she keeps this theory to herself, probably because she knows nobody ever listens to her anyway. One fine day, she gets roped into going on a forever long walk to nearby Winthrop, home of Cousin Charles. Everyone comes along, which means Anne gets to feel like the sixth or seventh wheel throughout. Yay. Louisa makes a melodramatic declaration about how sheâd rather end up dead in a carriage crash with her true love than remain at home without him <strong>(AN: even Austen had annoying tweens in her stories!)</strong>. Or something.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While the others send Henrietta down to Winthrop to un-friendzone Cousin Charles, the group splits up and Anne accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation between Wentworth and Louisa. Wentworth makes a pointed speech about happy hazelnuts and how wishy-washy people are the worst ever. Anne, guilty of once being wishy-washy, feels ten billion times worse than before. But then Louisa starts ranting about how much Mary sucks as a sister-in-law and mentions that her brother almost married Anne instead. Louisa wishes that this event had taken place, but Anne turned down the proposal. Wentworth realizes that this happened not long after she broke the engagement with him. #Gamechanger</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the Crofts come along in their carriage, Wentworth endeavors to get Anne on board so she wonât have to walk all the way back to Uppercross with the rest of the circus. âShe understood him. He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling.â Or maybe he realized what a colossal jerk he was being and decided to take a break from that gig for a while, who knows.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Life is unfair, so Anne keeps getting roped into random trips and excursions that include Wentworth. This time itâs a seaside jaunt to the town of Lyme, which is apparently super awesome <strong>(AN: I just still a place that shares its name with a disease would be somewhere willingly want to go)</strong>. We meet Wentworthâs seafaring bros, Harville and Benwick, who both currently reside in Lyme. Benwick was engaged to Harvilleâs sister Fanny, but she died while he was at sea and plunged him into a never-ending spiral of despair. A great deal of Anneâs time is spent chatting with Benwick about brooding poetry and other emo things. In a classic Anne move, she tries to help him see the brighter side of things, but then wonders if she shouldnât practice what she preaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Warning:</strong> This chapter was 10 different kinds of ridiculous.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne gets some admiring glances from a mystery man staying at the same innâ¦ who is later revealed to be none other than the estranged Elliott cousin, William Walter! You know, the guy whoâs inheriting Sir Walterâs title and estate. Also the one who was supposed to marry Elizabeth, but didnât. (Who could blame him? Sheâs awful.) Wentworth notices the admiring glances and PRETENDS like he isnât bothered by them. But I could totally tell. Nice try, dude.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Everyone goes gallivanting around town for one last hurrah before they need to head back to Uppercross. Anne is genuinely sad to be leaving &#8212; for once, she kinda had a good time. Chatting about emo poetry with Benwick is waaaay better than talking about A) who Wentworth is probably going to marry B) why Wentworth is so freaking awesome or C) Maryâs various imaginary ailments, so I get where sheâs coming from here. Harville thanks Anne for hanging out with Benwick; I bet it gave him a break from all the emo for a little while.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Louisa decides it would be great fun to go around leaping from dangerous heights. Wentworth tries to <em>persuade</em> her (see what I did there? SEE WHAT JANE AUSTEN DID THERE??) not to do it, but she wonât listen and ends up CRACKING HER HEAD OPEN.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Okay she didnât crack it open but she certainly cracked it at the very least. Everyone flips out because Louisa appears to be dead. I am flipping out cause WHAT!!!! As per usual only Anne manages to get a grip. Wentworth is having an aneurism of guilt and shame, but Anne is lucid enough (and awesome enough) to be like, âOh, what was that?? But I thought you didnât like women who were âwishy-washyâ and could be convinced to change their minds????? Not such a happy hazelnut anymore, are you??!!â But she doesnât say it out loud, of course, because Anne is a classy lady. I am not a classy lady, and therefore I was totally thinking the same thing AND saying it out loud.Â <strong>(AN: this entire paragraph is A+)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Musgroves split up, some staying with Louisa at the Harvillesâ house in Lyme while the others, including Anne and Wentworth, get the jolly task of telling the Musgrove parents that one of their daughters dashed her head open at the beach. Thus ends Part I of the book. /CLIFFHANGER</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s it for this week! Stay tuned for <strong>Part III of my <em>Persuasion</em> recap</strong>, coming next Saturday! And thanks everyone for your wonderful comments on last week&#8217;s post &#8212; you may be interested to know that I&#8217;ve decided to recap other Austen works in the future, since this feature got such a good reception. Also because Alix said so. Hahahaha <b>(AN: Yaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!)</b></h3>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-1f78-af09-553a-01aaef6c2353" style="text-align: justify;">Â I have no qualms about admitting that I donât read classics very often. Everyone around here should know by now that Iâm on this blog mainly to act as a notorious ringleader for all kinds of shenanigans. Classics arenât really shenanigan material, so they are more the domain of my much more poised and dignified co-blogger, Alix. HOWEVERâ¦ I know Iâm not the only one out there who shies away from classics. We all have our reasons; they can be pretty intimidating, certainly, and the writing style takes adjustment. (As well as perseverance, and other virtues I might be lacking. Err&#8230;)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But fear not, my friends! I, armed with almost ten pages of notes and a lot of iced coffee, have compiled the following Essential Guide to Jane Austenâs Persuasion for those of us who are Austen-Challenged. Um, and for those of us who like shenanigans. Iâll tell you everything you need to know in four perfectly manageable installments that wonât be taxing on your brain cells.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This is intended for people who A) have read the book already or B) donât have issues with spoilers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ALSO IMPORTANT</strong>: This post is roughly 90% crack. And contains commentary by Alix</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE BASICS</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Four years ago, Anne Elliott had a whirlwind romance with adorable sailor Frederick Wentworth. They were engaged, but Anne broke things off on the (terrible) advice of her (only) friend, Lady Russell. But now Wentworth is back, twice as awesome and successful as he was when he left. Anne never stopped loving him, Wentworth is still pissed, and things are about to get SUPER awkward.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-3619"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>People You Should Know:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anne Elliott</strong>, long-suffering heroine; surrounded by pretentious morons</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Captain Frederick Wentworth</strong>, hero and jilted fiancee; not bitter about this AT ALL</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Henrietta Musgrove</strong>, another sister of Charles; less impulsive, but still pleasant</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uppercross</strong> &#8211; Residence of the Musgroves, Anneâs family through her sisterâs marriage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camden Place</strong> &#8211; The Elliott townhouse in the seaside town of Bath, where they are forced to move when they rent out Kellynch Hall.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lyme</strong> &#8211; Another charming seaside town; home of the Harvilles and Mr. BennickÂ <strong>(A: I cannot help but always call lyme disease&#8230; SEE I CAN BE SILLY TOO!)</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PART I</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter One</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We meet the Elliotts of Kellynch Hall, most of whom are snobby and unpleasant, with the notable exception of Anne. Naturally, since sheâs nothing like the rest of her family, they donât think much of her at all. Sir Walter, the family patriarch, is exceedingly vain and doesnât think highly of people he deems less attractive than himself. Also obsessed with social rank &amp; the British Peerage. He and eldest daughter Elizabeth are like two peas in a pod. They are incurable spendthrifts who have drained the estateâs finances, leaving the Elliotts with little choice but to rent out Kellynch Hall. The third Elliott sister, Mary, got married a while ago and lives not so far away at Uppercross with her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne spends most of her time having to deal with her hateful family, but perseveres in being patient and kind anyway. Even so, she still ranks dead last on her fatherâs list of favorite people, because he is a jerk. The only person who seems to appreciate her is Lady Russell, who was a friend of her motherâs.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We also learn of a cousin named William Walter Elliott (henceforth to be referred to as Cousin Elliott to minimize confusion) who will be inheriting Kellynch Hall and the title when Sir Walter dies. Apparently he is a despicable human being who talked smack about the Elliotts and then married someone else instead of Anneâs sister, Elizabeth. #Scandal</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is decided that the Elliotts must rent Kellynch Hall in order to avoid losing it forever, since they donât have the money for upkeep anymore. Sir W and Elizabeth are convinced by their solicitor and Lady R to move to the seaside town of Bath. Anne isnât thrilled about this, but no one cares what she thinks. Tagging along to Bath is Mrs. Clay, their solicitorâs widowed daughter, who is good friends with Elizabeth but not someone Lady R thinks very highly of.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Potential tenants are found for Kellynch Hall: Admiral Croft and his wife. The solicitor advises Sir W that a naval officer would be a fantastic choice to rent the estate due to their many virtues, plus it would be a good cover-up for the real reasons why the Elliotts are having to move away (i.e. Sir W sucks at managing money). Sir W expresses his wariness of seafaring men, who are often A) enterprising individuals who actually work for a living in order to succeed in life and B) not very attractive according to his high standards. <strong>(A: he is such a superficial douche king)</strong>Â He also doesnât want the future tenants to have access to the entire estate because he is, as you might have guessed by now, kind of an ass.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is revealed that Admiral Croftâs wife is also the sister of none other than Anneâs former love, Frederick Wentworth. Cue angst and initial waves of awkwardness as Anne realizes that this means their paths are very likely to cross again in the near future. Ever since taking Lady Râs (awful) advice to break off the engagement, Anne has never been the same.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The Crofts are approved to rent Kellynch Hall and the Elliotts prepare for their move to Bath. Once again, ainât nobody got time for Anneâs feelings. Younger sister and total drama queen Mary whines at Anne to come to Uppercross and take care of her during yet another of her (imaginary) bouts of illness. Meanwhile, Elizabeth makes it plain that she could care less what Anne does or where she goes.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But because Anne is a good person, she takes precious time out of her busy and productive life to attempt to warn her mean sister that Mrs. Clay might not be in this for her friendship. In fact, Anne suspects Mrs. Clay is only being friendly because she has plans to marry Sir Walter and become the new Lady Elliott <strong>(A: dun-dun-dunnnn!)</strong>. Elizabeth shoots this idea down on the basis that Mrs. Clay is ugly, has freckles for crying out loud, plus have you seen her unfortunately weird tooth?? <strong>(A: *dies laughing*)Â </strong>Anne shrugs and moves on with a clear conscience. I mean, at least she tried.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne arrives at Uppercross, home of her sister Mary and brother-in-law Charles, as well as the rest of the Musgroves and Anneâs obnoxious little nephews. We discover that Mary is a total hypochondriac and also has questionable parenting skills (or lack thereof.) Almost immediately, Anne becomes the person everyone dumps their problems on. Sheâs just such a good listener. We meet the rest of the Musgroves, who are a much more pleasant bunch than the Elliotts are. Meanwhile, Admiral and Mrs. Croft move in over at Kellynch Hall and come to Uppercross for a visit. It is announced that the day of Anneâs doom is swiftly approaching: Mrs. Croftâs brother, Captain Wentworth, is indeed returning to England after spending a few years having adventures on the high seas. Coincidentally, he was Captain of the ship where the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son, Richard, was assigned before he died. Itâs a small world after all.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne is saved at the last minute when one of her obnoxious nephews conveniently breaks his collarbone, thus derailing plans for a social engagement where Captain Wentworth will be present. Mary and Charles saddle her with their injured offspring and frolic over to the Musgrovesâ main estate to meet Wentworth anyway. Anne is relieved that she doesnât have to face him just yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The next day, Anne is forced to endure widespread squee-ing and giddiness over Captain Wentworthâs apparent hotness. Both of Charlesâ young, single, and perfectly pleasant sisters now have massive crushes on him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne manages to avoid Wentworth several more times, but they meet again at last when he comes for an unexpected visit to Uppercross. This encounter is mercifully brief, and she is extremely glad when itâs over. But later, Mary tells Anne about a conversation she had with Wentworth in which he declared that Anne is, âchanged beyond recognition.â Anne is sucker punched in the face AND SO AM I. <strong>(A: he is unfortunately a douche for saying that)Â </strong><em>Ouch</em>, Wentworth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">âShe had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and timidity.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation: Wentworth is not bitter at all, guys! Whew, I was so worried!! Maybe this isn&#8217;t going to be so awkward after all!Â <strong>(A: bwahahahahaha)</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>TO BE CONTINUED</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Part II goes up next weekend! Like it, love it, want to slap me for what I&#8217;ve done to Jane Austen?? Do tell!</h3>

<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5dcead04-abde-61c1-304d-b760d53a0bac" style="text-align: left;">Welcome to our first Classics Retold post! Paola &amp; I are super excited to be part of this event. We picked Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em> as our classic tale that we will be spending the month exploring different retellings of! If you <s>live under a rock below a boulder</s> don&#8217;t know anything aboutÂ <em>Persuasion</em>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion_(novel)" target="_blank">here&#8217;s the wiki page</a>. ;)</h3>
<h3>When Paola told me about the event, I asked her if we could do Persuasion since it is my second favourite Jane Austen. Paola kindly obliged. :) In our first post, I interview her about her reading experience!</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img class="wp-image-2102 alignnone" alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a>How much did you want to punch Alix in the face for making you read Austen again? (Kidding! But seriously&#8230; )</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img class="wp-image-2103 alignnone" alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a><em>Ha! I did NOT want to punch Alix in the face. When I sent her the link to the Classics Retold event, I fully expected her to vote for an Austen title. (You think I donât know you, Alix??) Actually I expected her to pick Pride and Prejudice. I had this whole scenario played out in my mind:</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Me: So we meet again, Pride and Prejudice.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Pride and Prejudice: MUAHAHAHAHAÂ <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: hahahahahaha)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>But thatâs not what happened, because Alix picked Persuasion, and I know it was because she REALLY wanted me to have a good experience with Jane Austen, Round 2. <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: I really did!</strong><strong>)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong>What, if anything, did you know about Persuasion before reading it?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a><em>Not much! I did know that Anne Elliott was older than the usual Jane Austen heroine &#8212; sheâs in her late twenties &#8212; and I knew it was a story about missed chances in life.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: *cough* I think the term you&#8217;re looking for is &#8220;spinster&#8221;. :P)</strong></em></p>
<p><span id="more-3529"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong>How often to read classic English lit? Did you struggle with the writing style?</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>I havenât read classic English lit since I was in school. Itâs not something I do voluntarily, like eating cookies or running amok on Twitter while Alix isnât watching. I think the writing style is definitely a deterrent here because while it isnât necessarily difficult, it is time consuming to pick apart the sentences for what they really mean. Not kidding, when I started reading Persuasion in earnest I went into it armed with a notebook and full acceptance that this was going to take a while. The writing style isnât bad &#8212; Jane Austen is actually pretty funny, and pretty frequently at that &#8212; but itâs not the style that I naturally gravitate to.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: very true the reward is once you get into her writing, you can see just how witty she was and see theÂ depthÂ of the social commentary of the time that she was giving.)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>How long did it take you to get into the story? What were your initial thoughts about it?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Not long, actually. Initial thoughts: Anne Elliott is surrounded by pretentious douchebags, she REALLY needs a hug, and was she adopted??? Because WOW.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>Going into the book, did you have any apprehensions/worries since you didnât enjoy Pride &amp; Prejudice (which you gave only 1 star to BUT ITâS OK I FORGIVE FOR YOUR LACK OF CLASSY TASTE! ;))?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Yes, of course I had apprehensions. As mentioned above, I donât naturally lean towards classics as my reading of choice. I very much prefer fantasy, whether adult or YA, so this was outside my comfort zone. And yes, I did give Pride and Prejudice aÂ pitifulÂ number of stars, but in myÂ defenceÂ I attempted to read that book AGES ago and I donât even remember why I disliked it so much. I had to read it in high school for some reason or another. When you first sign up with Goodreads, they throw a bunch of books at you and say, âRATE THESE!â Err, so I rated it low because I didnât remember it being an enjoyable experience. Ah, well. Doomed to be un-classy. HahahaÂ <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: mais non Paola you are totally a CLASSY LADY! ;)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>Did you like Persuasion better than Pride &amp; Prejudice?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>I did &#8212; or at least it was much more enjoyable than my memory of reading Pride and Prejudice. This book has ALL THE FEELS.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: YAYAYAYAYAYAY :D)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>Persuasion is considered very different from other Austen works because it features an older heroine. Did you find it affected your enjoyment of it?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Honestly, I think Anneâs age was a big reason why I was able to relate to this book so much. It can be a real struggle sympathizing with all the teenagers and rampant immaturity in some of the YA books I read and review for the blog, so itâs refreshing when I encounter characters who are closer to my own age. I mean, age isnât an indicator of maturity by any means (for example, Iâm 26 and would still be happier finger painting than shopping for groceries&#8230; <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: dude, who doesn&#8217;t?!?</strong>), but in this case we do get a more mature heroine in Anne and I was happy about that.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>What did you think of Anne?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>I really, really liked her. Although I did find myself wishing she would stand up for herself more often, she was still the kind of character you canât help wanting a happy ending for. Anne deserves it. The majority of the people in her life do NOT support her in any way &#8212; sheâs always the one left out. She takes care of things while theyâre off being colossal idiots. This is a lot of responsibility, and itâs greatly affected the person that she is. Anne has to learn how to be a little more selfish, to reach out and take that chance for happiness when it comes around a second time. I was definitely on her side.Â <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: YES TO ALL OF THIS. I find that those around Anne have basically written her off because they consider her a spinster and take her for granted and the fact that she will always be there, part of the decor, to take care of everything.)</strong></em></em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Ha! Oh, heâs perfect for Anne. I agree with her &#8212; THERE CAN BE NO ONE ELSE! But I did think he was being rather immature at times <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: YES!)</strong></em>, such as during the earlier encounters with Anne but especially when Louisa was injured and he stayed for the obligatory amount of timeâ¦ but then totally bolted. Later he explains to Anne that he freaked out because everyone seemed to think he and Louisa were engaged (gee, Wentworth, I wonder how they got THAT impression???) but he didnât love her. So your solution was to run away to your brotherâs house and hide there for a while?? Boys are so dumb sometimes.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>ANYWAY, I did like him and I loved these two together very much.

It made me swoon and want to sway my dress skirt around if I was wearing one!)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>What did you think of Louisa Musgrove &amp; Captain Benwickâs romance? I loved them almost as much as I did Anne/Captain Wentworth.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>I was happy for Louisa and Benwick! Mostly for Benwick because that guy really needed to catch a break, wow. It kind of cracked me up that everyone else around them seemed totally confused as to how/why they were ever attracted to each other. But I liked that turn of events, for sure!Â <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: The reveal of their relationship and everyoneÂ flabbergastedÂ reaction is one of my favourite things about Persuasion!)</strong></em></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>What over the overall story? And the commentary on the power of influence and making choices for oneself?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Loved this bookâs message. Itâs about second chances, and standing by the choices that just feel right, even when everyone else tells you itâs wrong. I loved that Anne learns to follow her heart without losing her head. I loved that Wentworth realized that even though Anne changed her mind, it didnât mean she had a change of heart.Â <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: Agreed. What makes this book for me is encountering an &#8220;older&#8221; heroine who has learned from her mistakes and grown from it into a stronger more independent woman. The idea of second chances I find is repeated not just with Anne but also Musgrove.)</strong></em></em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png"><img alt="A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/A.png" width="65" height="73" /></a></strong></strong></strong>How did your second Austen reading experience go? Would you recommend Persuasion? Possibly try another Austen novel? Do you no longer feel like punching Alix in the face (kidding! but seriously&#8230;).</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>It was a very positive experience that yielded copious amounts of notes, all of which are on crack. You will see evidence of this in tomorrowâs post, when I provide everyone with a chapter-by-chapter breakdown of Persuasion designed for people who arenât classy. I would recommend Persuasion <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: *checks for signs of theÂ apocalypse*)</strong></em>, and no, the world isnât ending <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: phew)</strong></em>. As for more Austen novels for me in the future, I may consider it on behalf of all the other Austen-challenged readers out there.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>And no, I donât want to punch Alix in the face! If I ever wanted to punch you in the face, it would only be with love~Â <em><strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: awwww!)</strong></em></em></p>

</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png"><img alt="P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>You should read Persuasion because it builds up very slowly but in the end it is one of the most worthwhile and satisfying love stories you&#8217;ll ever read.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: PERSUASION IS AWESOME AND EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT *cough*)</strong></em></p>

</strong></p>

They&#8217;re both forced to grow up and be the responsible person in their families, which makes their personalities very steady and reliable. And yet they&#8217;re both looking to the horizon all the time &#8212; Anne for the love she lost, and Cinder for the freedom she wants more than anything. So there you go, an unlikely match!<br />

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion" target="_blank"><em>Persuasion</em></a> by Jane Austen</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At twenty-seven, Anne Elliot is no longer young and has few romantic prospects. Eight years earlier, she had been persuaded by her friend Lady Russell to break off her engagement to Frederick Wentworth, a handsome naval captain with neither fortune nor rank. What happens when they encounter each other again is movingly told in Jane Austenâs last completed novel. Set in the fashionable societies of Lyme Regis and Bath, <em>Persuasion</em> is a brilliant satire of vanity and pretension, but, above all, it is a love story tinged with the heartache of missed opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We chose <em>Persuasion</em> because&#8230;</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong></em>: I have loved Jane Austen since I was a young teenager! My mom introduced me to her via the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice_(1995_TV_series)" target="_blank">Â <del>in</del>famous 1995 BBC mini-seriesÂ <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> starring Colin Firth</a>! After watching and falling in love with the story of Elizabeth &amp; Darcy, I went out and got myself the <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Complete-Novels-Of-Jane-Austen/dp/0140259449/" target="_blank">Complete Novels of Jane Austen</a>Â (one huge brick of a book that gave my arms quite the workout while reading!).Â <em>Persuasion </em>was not immediately a favourite Austen novel of mine, it took my reading it again years later to fall in love with the story of Anne Elliot. Now it is my second favourite Austen novel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong></em>: Confession time! I am actually not a big Jane Austen fan. (Cue horrified gasps!) I had this terrible experience trying to read <em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em> many, many years ago and I&#8217;m afraid the ordeal frightened me away from all things Austen. However, I do believe that it&#8217;s time for me to give it another chance and see how I like the books now that I&#8217;m older and (possibly?) wiser. I actually love the Regency era and books set in that time period, so I feel like that&#8217;s another reason to allow Miss Austen a second chance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">And we&#8217;ll be reading/watching these adaptations&#8230;</span></h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/009_gonewiththewind.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-630" title="009_gonewiththewind" src="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/009_gonewiththewind.png" alt="Gone With the Wind" width="140" height="200" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <em>Gone With the Wind</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Margaret Mitchell</p>
<p><strong>PAGES</strong>: 832</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What book, what heroine, could be more iconic of the Antebellum South than <em>Gone With the Wind</em> and its indomitable Katie Scarlett O&#8217;Hara? On the eve of the Civil War, we meet a woman whose strength and sheer willpower become both her salvation and her downfall. Scarlett is hardly afraid to do whatever she has to do in order to achieve her means, whether it&#8217;s batting her eyelashes at a man or taking a rifle and shooting him in the face. Nevertheless, this novel is not only about the whirlwind force that is Scarlett O&#8217;Hara; at its heart, it is about the South as it once was, as no Southerner ever dreamed it would ever be otherwise. It is about sweeping plantations and wraparound porches, about dancing in the Georgia summertime. It is about war and all of its destruction, but also about war and all of its power to bring out the truth about humanity. It is about America at its most divided. It is about love: the deep, binding love for family and for home, as well as the tempestuous, often painful love encountered when Scarlett O&#8217;Hara meets her match in Rhett Butler. It is about a people watching everything they know disappearing, a way of life in its death throes on the floor. A true epic, this novel examines, through the victories and defeats of one woman, the very victories and defeats of her native South.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the first thing to say about this book is, it took me three tries to get past the first chapter, and this was an effort that spanned several years. I think that all the other times I checked it out, I was too distracted by other things to really get into it. It is not an easy read, and by far not a short one. There are times during its 800+ pages that my stamina waned and I had to put it down for a few days for lighter fare. However, I always returned to it, I guess in the same way Scarlett always returns to Tara, always gravitates toward home. The book is a masterpiece in characterization, especially when it comes to Scarlett O&#8217;Hara. I would argue with anyone who said she wasn&#8217;t one of the most conflicted, the most brilliantly written, the most irritating, the most inspiring, women in literature. And I say this without even being a huge fan of Scarlett (I know, I know, who isn&#8217;t a huge fan of Scarlett&#8230;whatever, I&#8217;m trying to explain!). Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8212; I think that if I had read this book when I was a bit younger, I would have gotten right on board with the Scarlett fan club. It isn&#8217;t that I don&#8217;t love her, because I do, but I am more of a Melanie fan. You would have to read the book to find out more about Melanie, but suffice it to say that she was half dead with illness and yet still stood at the top of the stairs with her dead brother&#8217;s sword in her hand, ready to kill whoever was trying to rob their house. Not that she had to raise that sword, due to Scarlett conveniently shooting the robber in the face, but this is precisely where my conflict lies. I admire Scarlett&#8217;s drive, her ruthlessness, because there is a part of me that would probably be the exact same way given the situation. At the same time, I admire Melanie&#8217;s will of steel simply because she outwardly does not show how strong she really is. She&#8217;s strong in a different way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But anyway, that paragraph is just one part of why I really loved this book. It is written with so much skill, there is so much power in the words and so much depth to every character. There is no relationship that can be taken at face value, not even relationships that seem easy to figure out at first glance. Just as I love Scarlett for the fire in her eyes, I fear her for the burning determination to take what she wants regardless of what she must destroy to achieve it. Just as I feel the heartbreak of the South at the death of everything it holds dear, I can&#8217;t forgive it for the slavery that built its mansions. The book is complicated. So is life. So was the Civil War. There is no better piece of literature to convey this. It was so good, I went on a total Civil War stretch this year hahahahaha. (You&#8217;ll see in later book reviews&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In any case, someday when you feel ready to handle the beast that is <em>Gone with the Wind</em>, DO IT. And when you have finished it, run and pick up the two official sequels/companion novels, as authorized by the estate of Margaret Mitchell: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scarlett-Sequel-Margaret-Mitchells-Gone/dp/B0029LHX6M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279401365&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank"><em>Scarlett</em></a> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rhett-Butlers-People-Donald-McCaig/dp/B001FOR5Z8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1279401398&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Rhett Butler&#8217;s People</a></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh. All this time I didn&#8217;t even mention Rhett Butler and my undying love for him. WELL. Make that Selling Point #457. Hahahaha.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Muriel Spark</p>
<p><strong>PAGES</strong>: 160</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unorthodox at best, Jean Brodie is the most controversial teacher at the rather conservative Marcia Blaine School for Girls. Her eccentricity and strong beliefs, combined with her insistence that she is currently in the &#8220;prime&#8221; of her life, lead her to assemble a close group of her favorite students in an attempt to pass on her knowledge and expertise. Seeking to mold these young women into her ideals, she brings out what she sees as the best in them while also looking at each of them as a personal triumph for herself. Passionate in everything from her attractions to married men, her affairs with other instructors, her blatant disregard for society&#8217;s rules and norms, and above all in living at her &#8220;prime,&#8221; Jean Brodie inspires each of the girls to a nearly cult-like devotion. They would follow her to victory or ruin&#8212; but one of them will choose to betray her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I read this book astonishingly slowly, considering it wasn&#8217;t very long. There are some extremely good quotes from it that I ended up not being able to write down thanks to my highly abbreviated reading window at the time, which was approximately 30 minutes while I bolted down lunch and waited to pick up my first graders from the playground. In any case, the story of Jean Brodie&#8217;s rise and fall at the hands of her own beloved students is a balance of tedious and intriguing. I found it interesting how she found a spark of something special in each of her favorites, but even then these things about them were not what defined them by the end. It was a testament to the fact that anything can happen in life. Jean Brodie could tell the girls what was special about them, could put them on the path to greatness, but she could not control their feet as they tread upon it. Nor could she have guessed that one of her chosen few would bring her to ruin. In all, an okay book. This is usually how I feel about books that are supposedly classics, so I wasn&#8217;t all that surprised. The funny thing is, I actually agreed with a lot of Miss Brodie&#8217;s teaching methods, which were definitely more open-minded than was appropriate in the setting of the story. But, there is a reason why they tell you not to pick favorites as a teacher&#8230;haha.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Truman Capote</p>
<p><strong>PAGES</strong>: 160</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Has there ever been another woman half as enchanting as Holly Golightly? She drinks her milk in a wine goblet, calls everyone darling, climbs through windows, hides behind a brilliant smile and giant sunglasses, slips random French phrases into exclamations about cats, and wears elbow length gloves as she eats breakfast in front of the display window of Tiffany&#8217;s in New York City. Captivating many men while belonging to virtually none of them, Holly goes about life with an attitude all her own. Immortalized by the legendary Audrey Hepburn in the film of the same name, there is more to this exuberant and timeless character than her outward nonchalance and the impeccable wardrobe she dons every morning. Holly wants nothing more than a place that feels like home, a place that makes her feel as grand as Tiffany&#8217;s. But to what ends will she go, to achieve this dream? And what has she been willing to become?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made was buying this DVD and watching it. At the time, I had no clue it was actually a novella before it was adapted for film, and so I didn&#8217;t think to look for a book until this year. The book is very much the same as the movie, and I feel like if I hadn&#8217;t already seen Audrey Hepburn playing Holly Golightly on screen, I would still not be able to envision anyone else in that role. I think, after reading and being able to compare, that Truman Capote&#8217;s Holly is a much darker character than the Holly portrayed by Hepburn; in the book, Holly is tangled in the same crazy problems, wrestling with the same identity crisis, but somehow I felt sadness and vulnerability in Audrey Hepburn&#8217;s version of Holly as opposed to the raw despair and sharp ruthlessness that radiated from Holly in the book. Not that it matters, because in the end Holly Golightly is still one of my absolute favorite people ever, especially since she&#8217;s the source of some of my absolute favorite quotes ever, such as the universally appropriate, &#8220;Golly gee damn!&#8221; If you have not already read the book or seen the film, what are you waiting for?? Highly recommended! The book itself is technically only a novella, which makes it a brief read, but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
