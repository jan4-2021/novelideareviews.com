<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73884089-e18a-b3bc-d12e-83ce9f8c4ecc" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Guess what time of the year it is? Itâsâ¦.. NOVEMBER! And that meansâ¦.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: â¦ NaNoWriMo! Or, <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>, in case you arenât familiar with the crazy 30 days of the year when aspiring writers try to write a 50k novel in one month. <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte </a>and I are both participating this year, and we wanted to reach out to others who might be doing the same thing. (You know, all the other crazy people.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: (Doing all these crazy things haha) Basically our support group is not just limited to bloggers, weâre inviting all bookish people to participate! So you can either just make blog posts, discuss and chat in our GR group and so on! The whole point of our support group is to provide well literally, support to all fellow writers out there attempting NaNoWriMo this year and to help you get through those gruelling 30 days!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Weâll be here for you through whatever youâre going through in your writing adventures (err, or misadventuresâ¦) and we hope the support group will become a fun community where you can talk about your project, get constructive criticism and inspiration, or just hang out when you feel like your brain is about to explode.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Weâve got your back in November ;) Youâre not alone in this, Writers Unite!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3992"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: <em><strong>To sign up, just <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">fill out the form</a> to be added to the list of participants.</strong></em> We also have a group on Goodreads specifically for the event; youâll find the link at the end of the <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">sign-up form</a>! Once youâve done this, you have until the end of October to write up an intro post.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: <em><strong>For your intro post, tell us a little bit about yourselves and your NaNo experience &#8211; have you participated before? Is this your first time? Any challenges you think youâll face? What are your goals? And if you feel comfortable sharing with us, maybe the synopsis of your novel or the title :)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: You can write your intro post any time before November 1st and add it to our linky list on <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/writers-unite-participant-list/" target="_blank">the participants page</a> over here! We also have a <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/2013/10/writers-unite-intro-post/" target="_blank">sample intro post</a> from Charlotte if you need inspiration.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the event weâll be posting about our progress once a week, and we hope you will too! Bloggers and non-bloggers can participate in this; if you donât have a blog, weâll have a thread in the Goodreads group where you can talk about how youâre doing. Also, on Wednesdays weâll be doing some fun posts to get into the writing spirit! Here are some ideas for topics you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Interview one of your characters</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Come up with a playlist for your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Do you have a writing ritual?</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>What reward you&#8217;ve got lined up when you write that 50k!</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Dream cast your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Essential tools that help you write</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: The fun posts are optional so donât feel pressurised to make sure you get a post up every Wednesday. If youâre going through Writerâs Block or need to just write something else apart from your novel, these posts can be a great help!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: That&#8217;s it! <strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">Sign up on the form</a>, get your <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/2013/10/writers-unite-intro-post/" target="_blank">intro post</a> written, <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/writers-unite-participant-list/" target="_blank">link it up here</a>, and also check out the tentative schedule for the event</strong>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Unlike my experience actually reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> for the first time, the story behind how I discovered the book isn&#8217;t at all exciting. I devour fantasy books on a regular basis and I&#8217;m always looking for my next escape, which is what led me to Lumatere. I remember skimming through a few reviews on Goodreads and finding myself compelled by the sheer amount of people who were rendered incoherent and/or speechless by this book. This got me thinking that I should probably pick it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="finnpost01" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/finnpost01-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></strong>Some 400 pages later, I realized this had been one of the best literary moments of my life. EVER. But I&#8217;d packed my bags and applied for permanent citizenship long before that. Maybe it was the first time Evanjalin rolled her eyes at Finnikin. (And all the subsequent times hahaha) Maybe it was every single time these characters kept going, never giving up on the home they&#8217;d been forced to leave behind. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on when it happened exactly, but somewhere on that journey I decided I belonged there too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3909"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think many of us who read fantasy are drawn to the genre because A) it gives us a chance to get away to an entirely different world and/or B) it gives us a chance to live in a world where the epic and the legendary are still possible. Lumatere exemplifies both, for me. This is a place where there is power in every promise, where honor and loyalty still matter, where love is unbreakable. These are people who do absolutely nothing by halves, whether it&#8217;s living or loving or dying. It&#8217;s where friendship is a bond that lasts forever, where I&#8217;ve witnessed every possible way to be brave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It never ceases to amaze. Melina Marchetta is capable of rendering me into a sobbing, laughing, inarticulate mess with only one sentence. This universe of hers even seems to be rendered in colors more vivid than the ones in our spectrum, to the point that reading this series somehow made me feel more <em>alive</em>. And I guess this feeling just makes me want to take this book and give it to everyone I meet. I just want you to see what I see. I want you to experience this crazy, crushing, heartbreaking, exhilarating, BEAUTIFUL feeling. It&#8217;s why I came to Lumatere and never left.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Special Bulletin From Your Finnikin Ambassador</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As most of you are well aware, I have made it my mission in life to <del>harass</del> convince everyone in the universe to read an incredible high fantasy series called <em>The Lumatere Chronicles </em>(<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>, <a title="Froi of the Exiles" href="http://novelideareviews.com/froi-of-the-exiles/"><em>Froi of the Exiles</em></a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15754483-quintana-of-charyn" target="_blank"><em>Quintana of Charyn</em></a>), by Melina Marchetta. I can&#8217;t even begin to express to you how much I love these books &#8212; they leave me an inarticulate, sobbing, comatose mess. After finally reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> earlier this year (WHERE HAD IT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!) I subsequently spread the Finnikin fever to several friends, happy customers all, and now we gush about the series frequently. One of those friends is the lovely <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Charlene</a> over at <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>, and we&#8217;ve teamed up to put together an entire event dedicated to our shared obsession. You can get more details from <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">our intro post at Charlene&#8217;s blog</a>, but basically we&#8217;ll be hosting a read-along of the first book as well as three weeks of posts from all over the book blogging world on <em>The Lumatere Chronicles</em>!</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Interview with Kay Honeyman, Part II</span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://t.co/wd77ftIbdX" target="_blank"><strong>Click here for Part I at Gypsy Reviews!</strong></a></h3>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #6f152e;">What were some challenges you encountered while writing a historical novel?</span></strong> <b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You canât assume anything when you are writing a historical novel. Sometimes you have to stop in the middle of a scene and find out how widespread indoor plumbing had become by 1923. I had to watch my metaphors for modern references. I also had to work within the social norms of the time and place. Itâs a fun puzzle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, I canât let the history get in the way of the story. I think the history should serve the story Iâm telling. It is easy to lose track of that when the history is so incredibly fascinating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3102"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #6f152e;">In what ways are you and Jade Moon alike? In what ways are you different?</span></strong><b> </b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We share a love of stories. I find them just as magical, comforting, and full of promise as Jade Moon does.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are both stubborn and strong willed. I house my stubbornness at my very center, while Jade Moon broadcasts hers to everyone around her. Mine is more like a metal file that wears people down. Jade Moonâs is like a sledgehammer. Hers works better on the page. Mine probably works better in life.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #6f152e;">What is your favorite scene in the book, and why?</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love the scenes when Jade Moon is learning to fight with Neil. Those two are so perfectly paired to drive each other crazy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also love the scene when Nushi says good-bye. It breaks my heart every time I read it even though I know she has to leave and Nushi has to let her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maybe my favorite scene is when Jade Moon tells the story to the women on Angel Island. It is this moment where Jade Moon is not a Fire Horse girl, but just a girl, trying to carve out a life she can live. It is a moment when she is her best self and she is combining her own boldness with the sympathy she feels for these women. I hope the women and the reader get a glimpse of who Jade Moon could be.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #6f152e;">Presently, headstrong and independent women are more accepted in society. If the time period shifted and The Fire Horse Girl was set in the modern day instead of the 20s, what kind of obstacles do you think Jade Moon would face?</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think she would still be challenged by her sense of justice and her stubborn determination. Sometimes I wonder where a Jade Moon would be in todayâs society. Would she be crossing the Mexican border? Confronting cyber bullies at her school? Trying to join the high school wrestling team? There are always boundaries to push and lines that should be crossed. And luckily there are people like Jade Moon to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of her story was built around the questions of identities and labels, starting with the Fire Horse sign. These labels are not about who we are as much as peopleâs reactions to who we are. I just finished <i>Divergent</i> (a wonderful story!) by Veronica Roth, and I can imagine Jade Moon in that society struggling with the same boundaries, expectations, and issues of identity.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #6f152e;">In your opinion, what makes a âstrong heroine?â What are some traits that help define the role for you?</span></strong><b></b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What a great question! I think that Jade Moonâs greatest moments of strength arenât when she is arguing or fighting. Her real strengths lie in her capacity of love, and her willingness to try, fail, and try again. Her strengths donât come from her outspoken words, but her heart. She loves and sacrifices with strength and determination. She is strongest when she places herself on the side of failure for the sake of someone else.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bunny.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3406" alt="bunny" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bunny-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a>Jade Moon was born under the sign of the Fire Horse in Chinese astrology. I, however, am a Fire Rabbit. (Actually, one of the reasons why there&#8217;s always a bunny lurking somewhere around here is because I was born in the year of the Rabbit! But also I just really like bunnies. #Duh #FunFactsAboutPaola) In the interview, Kay mentioned that labels are, &#8220;not so much about who we are as much as people&#8217;s reactions to who we are.&#8221; I think it&#8217;s true that labels don&#8217;t necessarily define us. For fun, I thought I&#8217;d include an excerpt of what the Internet has to say about Fire Rabbit girls and let you figure out just exactly who you&#8217;re dealing with here&#8230; hahaha. (That&#8217;s a photo of me, age 6, next to Malcolm &#8212; the original shelf rabbit/bunny book-end!)</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rabbits tend to move through life at their own pace, no matter what anyone else thinks. They are lucky and have long lives. They are very sensitive and gracious. They are natural diplomats. While they enjoy the quiet life and artistic pursuits, they are also very cunning. You&#8217;d never guess that they were strong willed. They tend to get their way through kindness. They are friendly and easy to get along with. They rarely get into serious trouble. They are discreet and usually land on their feet.&#8221; (<a href="http://www.alwaysastrology.com/chinese-rabbit.html" target="_blank">Source</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of that stuff is actually pretty true about me! Watch out for my cunning ways muahahaha~ Anyway, because we love <em>The Fire Horse Girl</em> so much, we want to share that love with you! <strong>We&#8217;re giving away one copy of the book to a lucky reader.</strong> Maybe check your horoscope and zodiac sign to maximize your luck??

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Brought to you by <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte @ Gypsy Reviews</a> + <a href="http://novelideareviews.com" target="_blank">Paola @ A Novel Idea</a>!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-31da4215-99d3-3edc-5c59-d9f13b430940" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: This event came into being one day when Charlotte and I were brainstorming some collab ideas for our two blogs. It occurred to us that, as Asian readers, it was very rare for us to find YA books that represented our culture. Asian settings and characters in the genre are pretty rare, and not always authentic or even anything we could identify with. Whereâs the love, people??</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Well, for the next three days, weâre bringing you all kinds of Asian Awesomeness. Itâs a celebration of books that showcase the depth and diversity of Asia, from fantasy with a touch of the Far East to historical fiction that brings those cultures to life. (And weâll probably also talk about Mulan, because letâs face it &#8212; sheâs a total badass.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Today, though, we&#8217;d like to take the liberty of debunking some common stereotypes that have made their way into literature and film. Because, you know, we&#8217;re experts.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3098"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #1: ALL ASIANS ARE FREAKISHLY SMART</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: There are so many typical Asian stereotypes found in books and movies and they are not true at all! First of all we have the Asians are Smart stereotype which bugs me so much because not all Asians are smart to that extent. Asians are just like any other people, weâre not all geniuses or whatever. It all really boils down to how in our culture, we emphasise more on studies and doing well in school, therefore weâre more inclined to study more and get good grades. So itâs not all intelligence, just our willingness to do well.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Want a fantastic example of why this is a myth?? I&#8217;m Asian and I ABSOLUTELY SUCK AT MATH. Like, beyond belief. I hate it so much. I declared it as my nemesis when I was in first grade and it just went downhill from there. Not all Asians are capable of calculating complex equations and chemical reactions within milliseconds. Some of us are total dunces at that stuff. Some of us (i.e. myself) are better at being Disney Princesses and herding preschoolers from Point A to Point B. So next time you need tutoring, nabbing the nearest Asian person may not be the solution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #2: ALL ASIANS ARE THE SAME</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: I hate when Asians are just kind of massed together, like all our various cultures, beliefs, backgrounds and ENTIRELY SEPARATE COUNTRIES can all be lumped together and labeled as the same general thing. There is so much diversity that people often seem to perceive as nothing more than an amorphous blob. No, we&#8217;re not all the same. Different parts of Asia yield different customs and traditions. For someone like me with a mixed Asian heritage (Filipino/Chinese), it becomes even more complex.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Also what really bothers me is when people get mixed up between Chinese and Japanese. They are not the same when you talk about Chinese characters and kanji which is more for Japanese. Kanji is basically Chinese characters that have the same meaning as the Chinese characters but they are pronounced differently.. Kanji is only Japanese. Chinese characters are called han zi (æ±å­). So please do not confuse the two because they are two entirely different languages! It really bothers me when people mix these two languages up especially when people call kanji Chinese &gt;&lt;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #3: ALL ASIAN PARENTS ARE TERRIFYING</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Not sure if all of you remember but when the Tiger Mum released her article for her book and revealed how she reared her daughters, a lot of people were quite shocked. It was quite shocking for me as well because her ways were very restricting. People probably got the idea that all Asian parents are this strict. Not true, it all really depends on the parentâs way of raising their child, some may choose to be more liberal and some more strict. Just because one parent does it, does not mean all Asian parents are like this.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: I mean, MY parents were pretty frightening at times (err, they still are), but they were definitely not as crazy as that lady. I think many Asian cultures share a system of values, and quite a few of those values don&#8217;t have the same importance in Western cultures. This is why it seems like Asian parents are much more strict. It&#8217;s true that my parents had very high expectations of me, and very true that they have their Asian-specific quirks that come from our culture, but no one was forcing me to practice the violin until my fingers bled or anything. Wow, that sounded kinda like a horror movie&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #4: ALL ASIANS ARE TINY &amp; ADORABLE</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Guess what? Some of us are tall. I&#8217;M not tall, per se, but I have a cousin who&#8217;s almost 7 ft. and possibly still growing. Oh, but this myth is only partially debunked because Charlotte and I are <em>totally</em> adorable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></strong></span>: YES THIS. Iâm considered tall, around 167cm (5.6ft I think?) and taller than most of my peers so this is debunked! That being said maybe most of the people I know are shorter than meâ¦ but at least not all Asians are tiny! Also yes, totally agree with Paola weâre adorable ;D *flashes my best smile*</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #5: ASIANS ARE BEST IN SUPPORTING ROLES</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Asians, or POC in general, in books and movies are usually delegated as âsupporting charactersâ only. Itâs a pretty common stereotype and I would love to see more Asians in main roles, I mean look at Mulan! She got a main role ;D Though people who donât call her a princess are rawrrrr, she saved China you guys, an entire country. Which Disney princess has done that eh? So she deserves that title haha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #6: MULAN SHOULD NOT BE A DISNEY PRINCESS</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: *points to Charlotte&#8217;s statement above* HELLO, REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAVED ALL OF CHINA??? PLUS she&#8217;s a beast at chess, an avid equestrienne, is capable of inventing ingenious ways to feed the chickens, <a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/290cda9649be03c2cd032db1ed6bc09c/tumblr_mqz4ubBAeZ1s20r7so1_500.gif" target="_blank">CUT HER HAIR OFF WITH A SWORD</a>&#8230; need I say more??? I remember being so excited when I realized that the next Disney heroine was going to look more like me than any of the others introduced previously. It meant a lot to this little girl to have a resilient, independent, clever female character to look up to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: I might be a little biased because I feel like I can relate to her, being Asian and all. But her values, such as being afraid to not live up to her parents and fail them is a very real fear. I love that sheâs so motivated in the end and strives to become a soldier and show that she is just as capable as the rest of the men. Mulan works hard and pushes on, she doesnât give up even when everyone is telling her she should. Sheâs such a strong female character and I look up to her so much, sheâs truly a fantastic role model :3</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://stabheuschrecke.tumblr.com/post/58713249848"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3386" alt="tumblr_mrsiyydefb1sqxr7go1_500" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/tumblr_mrsiyydefb1sqxr7go1_500.gif" width="500" height="313" /></a></p>

(Run away now while you can!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: So as avid readers &amp; reviewers, we tend to see a lot of things in books that drive us up the wall. This happens a lot to me while reading YA. Love triangles, Instalove, et al etc&#8230; there are just so many things I end up wishing I could change when Iâm reading a book that has these elements included. I think that this is how a lot of avid readers end up also becoming writers. We have all these smartass ideas for how to fix things, donât we? So letâs fix them! By writing our own!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>TORY</strong></span>: We got this idea from the final exam of Love Triangles 101, where several readers submitted their &#8220;essays&#8221; that ranged from super hilarious (lethal sneezing) to super level headed! Then because I (The Sleeping Latte who is typing this in half-awake state) thought that was a really, awesomely fun idea. Paola suggested a Round Robin Writing event! Some shenanigans went down (oh man, sorry Paola, I&#8217;m laughing at my own autocorrects lol) (<em><strong>Paola</strong>: itâs so awesome lololol</em>) thereafter that resulted in us being here! Now! Because we need you and your input to see if there&#8217;s enough interest in this! :&#8217;D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #960d12;">PAOLA</span></strong>: Basically everyone interested would be invited to group together and get started with some initial worldbuilding. We decided this would be more fun to do together and that way weâre all experts on the world weâve created and how it works. Then, we would start taking turns writing the chapters, one chapter at a time, and each chapter hosted at a different blog. If you wrote the chapter, you would host the story on your blog that day, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3323"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-44eb4eac-6f0d-6842-7e17-2447519ef740" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #960d12;">TORY</span></strong>: Right now, what we need to know is how many of you would be interested in participating in this event! It would probably take a while, as we are likely to give a week for each chapter to be posted. Therefore we are thinking of December as a possible starting month because November is NaNoWriMo so we&#8217;re guessing some of us might be a little busy (in my case, busy whining and ripping my hair out for words ha&#8230;ha&#8230;ha). Also, it&#8217;d be nice to know what kind of story you guys want to write, such as a parody of a genre or an entirely new story!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: But not contemporary because neither Tory nor I is any good at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>TORY</strong></span>: Hahaha yup, unless you want your character killed off :D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: OR ALL THE CHARACTERS KILLED OFF &gt;:D</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">So anyway, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about our crackpot scheme:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re looking for fellow bloggers/aspiring writers who are interested in collaborating on a story together!</li>
<li>Everyone participating will alternate writing chapters, with each new chapter posting on the writer&#8217;s blog that week.</li>
<li>There will be about a week in between chapters to (hopefully) give enough time for writing.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll all do the worldbuilding together<span style="color: #000000;">,</span> but the plot will not be outlined. We want to see where it goes!</li>
<li>There will be no minimum/maximum chapter length BUT there will be a chapter limit so that the story eventually ends.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re interested, fill out the form so we can contact you with further details!</li>
</ul>
