<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">The world is living in the shadow of oncoming disaster. An asteroid is set to strike the earth in just one weekâs time; catastrophe is unavoidable. The question isnât how to save the worldâthe question is, what to do with the time that&#8217;s left? Against this stark backdrop, three island teens wrestle with intertwining stories of love, friendship and familyâall with the ultimate stakes at hand.Â Â (from </span><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332270-tumble-fall" target="_blank">GoodReads</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was attracted to this title because its pretty cover and catching summary. I love stories sent against an on-coming/occurring apocalypse (I have watched <em>The Day After TomorrowÂ </em>an almost embarrassing number of times)Â soÂ <em>Tumble &amp; FallÂ </em>seemed right up my alley!</p>
<p>The story follows 3 teens living in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard who are each dealing with heavy emotional baggage in the wake of an asteroid about to hit Earth. Sienna, who is a &#8220;summer resident&#8221;, has just been taken out of a hospice by her dad where she was being treated for mental issues. Her father brings her to their summer home in the Vineyard, which they haven&#8217;t been to since her mother&#8217;s death years before, in hopes of making their possibly final days there happy. Once there, Sienna happily reunites with her younger brother but is shocked to find out that her father not only has a girlfriend but they plan to marry before the asteroid hits. Zan is an island native who has been struggling with the untimely death of her boyfriend over one year ago. As the end nears, Zan discovers that he might not have been the man she thought he was and start to question the premise of their relationship. Caden, another island native, comes from a broken home with an alcoholic mother and father who walked on them when he was a kid and never came back. Until now. Caden finds himself kidnaped by his father and forced to finally deal with his issues regarding his father and family.</p>
<p>I liked the premise of 3 separate story lines told by 3 different characters. I felt that while the characters weren&#8217;t connected beyond living their possibly final days in the same community, the 3 stories still related to each other since they were all dealing in one way or another with the same issues: abandonment and family.</p>
<p><span id="more-3618"></span>I struggled with the selfishness of the Sienna and Zan. I understand that as teenagers they would put love in front of family but it was never completely justified in a way that felt right with me. Sienna basically falls in love and abandons her family within a couple of days and Zan, despite what might be the end of the world fast approaching, cannot see beyond her broken heart to be with her family (I&#8217;m being a little harsh here since the character arcs does that these characters come to their senses eventually but it was all a little too late to me). That feeling of not completely understanding or being able to relate to the characters was something I struggled with for the whole book.</p>
<p>I thought Sienna was the most interesting character out of the 3 teens because she was the one who was the most broken (yes I also really like broken characters). I understood the motivation behind her actions the most because I felt like we got the most progression out of her inner monologued instead of the same repetition of things with Zan and Caden. I didn&#8217;t agree with her just abandoning her father and brother for some random guy she&#8217;s apparently in love with. But the story did a good job of explaining the issues she struggles with, being afraid of failing her father and brother, pushing them away and her fear of the depression she suffers from taking ahold of her in the same way it did her mother, that pushed her towards making that choice and then her subsequent ones that lead up to the end of her story.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like some of the choices that were made with Caden story. I know Caden&#8217;s father is meant to be portrayed as centred, controlling, a-hole but I really didn&#8217;t understand why he suddenly orders a prostitute to take his son&#8217;s virginity! Like seriously? WHY. How does he even know Caden is a virgin?!?! Just all of that encounter and resulting inner narration by Caden confrontation with his dad felt awkward and off in a really bad way. I understand that there needed to be something that happens to have Caden decide once and for all to cut ties with his add but I found the introduction of this virgin/prostitute storyline jarring and unnecessary. I really wish the author had made a different choice here. Oh and I also could have lived with Caden&#8217;s crush on his kinda-step-mother and everything that happened with her. It was a total clichÃ© if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Zan I found to be&#8230; boring. I never connected to her story. I thought she was whiny. I found the story about her half-sister to be way more interesting then her dead boyfriend&#8217;s but it took a back burner. I don&#8217;t really have much more to say about her. I also had a hard believing that it would be that easy for Zan to travel to Boston and back within that short of timeframe considering the oncoming asteroid.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with the book was that while it was character driven, the characters didn&#8217;t drive enough the story to make it captivating for me. I kept reading the book mostly because I still loved the premise and kept waiting be enthralled, for more to happen, to have one of the stories jump out at me. Yet it never happened. It eventually started to feel boring. There was a slowness to the pacing that didn&#8217;t work to me and while there was somewhat sense of oncoming doom, I didn&#8217;t find it prominent enough considering. I wanted to have that sense of the world might be about to end but unless one of the characters mentioned it or talked about the presidential speeches, I forgot more then once the larger context of the book.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Tumble &amp; Fall</em> was just an okay read for me. I was left feeling unsatisfied by the lack of captivating characters and the end didn&#8217;t work for me. The book had great potential and I don&#8217;t regret reading it. It just unfortunately not ended up being a memorable read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you toÂ Macmillan Children&#8217;s Publishing Group and NetGalley for providing an ARC in exchange of an honest review.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 1999, Viking Juvenile; Paperback, 228 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Colie dropped her extra pounds, she also dropped a way of life. Everything changed when she and her mother lost weight. Now her mom is known to the entire world as Kiki Sparks, fitness superstar, and she barely recognizes her. Reinvention hasn&#8217;t come as easily to Colie; she&#8217;s always had trouble making friends, and that was one thing that didn&#8217;t change when everything else in her life did. So when she finds herself packed off to spend her summer at the beach with her aunt, she isn&#8217;t expecting very much. Certainly not friendship, and definitely not love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I&#8217;ve said before, being able to predict what will happen doesn&#8217;t really bother me when I&#8217;m reading Sarah Dessen. In fact, it&#8217;s a big reason why I like reading her books. I pick them up because I want something familiar and comforting, and not to have my world turned upside down. I&#8217;ve always liked that she&#8217;s so good at sneaking something thought provoking into an everyday, ordinary situation. That being said, while I liked <em>Keeping the Moon</em> just fine, I didn&#8217;t connect with it as I have with other books by this author. I&#8217;d have to say it was the most predictable yet, and for the first time ever, this bugged me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2816"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve often heard Dessen books being criticized for being formulaic, and I&#8217;ve never denied that they are, for the most part. It&#8217;s true that you can definitely pick up a formula of sorts as you read more of her novels. Dessen girls are always troubled in some way, whether it&#8217;s an inner conflict or a problem caused by outside sources. She&#8217;s usually searching for her true self, sorting out what that means even as she deals with the other issues in her life, which can be a challenge when you&#8217;re in transition between childhood and adulthood. Meanwhile, Dessen boys tend to defy being judged by their covers. They&#8217;re always something more than what they appear. By the end of the story, revelations take place and lessons are learned. But what makes that predictability easy to accept is that the characters are always so likeable. They have quirks, personalities that are real and relevant, and there&#8217;s always something special about each one that helps them stand out. Some of the most endearing fictional people I&#8217;ve met so far have actually come from Dessen novels, and honestly I&#8217;ve yet to meet any main characters of hers that I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s the same with Colie, the protagonist of <em>Keeping the Moon</em>, but the difference this time is that liking her didn&#8217;t equate to connecting with her. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but something was missing here. I didn&#8217;t dislike her, but I didn&#8217;t love her either. There just wasn&#8217;t a spark there. Normally by the time I finish a book by this author, I feel like the main character is my best friend &#8212; that&#8217;s just how deeply you get to know them, and how well drawn they usually are. All the other Dessen girls I&#8217;ve encountered so far have these really distinctive voices that distinguish them, and their unique stories, from one another. Colie, however, was hard for me to get a good grasp on. This made it hard to like this book as much as I&#8217;ve liked the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This one definitely has the quirkiest cast of characters so far, in my opinion. This was actually my first impression of the book: that it had the craziest people in it! Colie&#8217;s mother is a fitness guru and the star of countless infomercials, so of course her personality is a bit over the top. Then there&#8217;s Colie&#8217;s eccentric Aunt Mira, whose house is crammed to the rafters with secondhand items that all have something mildly wrong with them &#8212; and all the flaws are labeled, of course.Â  Morgan and Isabel, Colie&#8217;s co-workers at Last Chance, aren&#8217;t extensively quirky but are definitely possessed of big personalities to make up for it. There are a lot of colorful people here, and I definitely love quirky characters, but once again I didn&#8217;t really feel that magical connection with them. &#8230;Wait! There was one exception: <em>Keeping the Moon</em>&#8216;s resident Dessen Boy, Norman. Ugh, I LOVE NORMAN. SO MUCH. He was my favorite person in this book. I thought he was an example of the right kind of quirky &#8212; a bit odd, but loveable because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&#8217;s the first of her books to be set in the seaside town of Colby, which is also the setting for <em>Along For the Ride</em> and her latest, <em>The Moon and More</em>. I&#8217;ve come to love Colby so it was interesting to see it in its earlier days!Â  It&#8217;s also one of her older novels, published in the late 90&#8242;s, and my experience has been more towards her newer titles so that may be part of why this one didn&#8217;t work as well. I didn&#8217;t recognize anyone from other books this time around since I&#8217;ve never read any of the stories that take place prior to it but now I&#8217;m wondering if I might see familiar faces from Keeping the Moon if I revisit Colby in the later novels&#8230;?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the first time ever, the predictability and comforting familiarity I normally love in a Dessen title came off as a bit disappointing. I&#8217;d say this is my least favorite of them so far, but only because it was the book I had the most difficulty connecting with. I feel like if this was one of the first I&#8217;d read from her, I wouldn&#8217;t be as big a fan as I am now&#8230; so I&#8217;m glad I read The Truth About Forever first. I am happy to see, though, that the author seems to have improved more and more with every book; after all, this is one of her earliest novels. Her more recent books are very near and dear to my heart and that has a lot to do with how adept she is when it comes to balancing that predictability with characters that surprise me and insights that I wasn&#8217;t expecting. I&#8217;m still a Sarah Dessen fan, but <em>Keeping the Moon</em> was only okay for me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Samuel Park</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction; Literary Fiction (Adult)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2011, Simon &amp; Schuster; Paperback, 336 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure everyone has come to a place in life where the paths diverge and there&#8217;s no turning back. Often, the biggest decisions we make are the ones we can&#8217;t change our mind about once they&#8217;re made &#8212; or at least, not without considerable grief, not to mention the consequences. Soo-ja, young and impulsive, headstrong and independent, longs for the kind of life her parents resolutely forbid her from living. She has dreams of becoming something more than what they want for her, and when she meets a boy named Min who tells her he can make those dreams come true, she decides to marry him despite her misgivings. Soo-ja is poised on the brink of running full tilt down that path until another man gives her a reason to look back, and to wonder if she made the right choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;What if?&#8221; This is the question that haunts every page of Soo-ja&#8217;s story, which remains one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s a book that lingers long after you put it down. I&#8217;ve since re-read it twice and recently realized that I&#8217;d never reviewed it here on the blog &#8212; a shame, considering how much I love it. Since we&#8217;re in the middle of our <a title="Welcome to Love Triangles 101! + GIVEAWAY!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/welcome-to-love-triangles-101-giveaway/">Love Triangles 101 event</a> right now, it seemed like the perfect time to talk about this book; no, it&#8217;s not YA, but I think those of us who read a lot of YA will find the handling of love triangles in <em>This Burns My Heart</em> to be much more realistic. Being torn between two men involves more than just having to choose Mr. Right. It also means making a choice between one life over another, giving up one world of possibilities that you might never have again. (And hey, if you&#8217;re a big Asian drama fan like me, this book would be the most sophisticated, heart-wrenching K-drama in the universe.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2884"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Chamara, Soo-ja. Chamara,&#8221; said Yul. Chamara. What is the word that comes closest to it? Soo-ja wondered. To stand it, to bear it, to grit your teeth and not cry out? To hold on, to wait until the worst is over? There is no other word for it, no way to translate it. It is not a word. It is a way to console yourself. He is not just telling her to stand the pain, but giving her comfort, the power to do so. Chamara is an incantation, and if she listens to its sound, she believes that she can do it, that she will push through this sadness. And if she is strong about it, she&#8217;ll be rewarded in the end. It is a way of saying, I know, I feel it, too. This burns my heart, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tension and drama between these three characters is woven with so much raw emotion, and yet with such obvious grace. You&#8217;ve probably heard of books that are described as &#8220;achingly beautiful,&#8221; and this is, in my opinion, the definition of that phrase. More often than not, the love triangles we see in YA don&#8217;t really explore how truly painful it really is to be trapped in that situation. It&#8217;s <em>not</em> fun, and when it involves adults, it also involves an entirely new level of heartbreak. Adults have responsibilities and obligations that teens and adolescents don&#8217;t necessarily need to consider. In this case, Soo-ja not only picks the wrong guy, but also marries him. Divorcing this man isn&#8217;t the short, snappy solution you might imagine. She can&#8217;t just extricate herself from the decision she made and start over fresh, not without paying a price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you will want her to do exactly that, especially because the man she really should be with is without a doubt the RIGHT guy in every sense of the word. (I dare you not to love Yul. <em>I just dare you.</em>) And her husband? SO WRONG. But nothing is that simple, and Soo-ja can&#8217;t rewind the clock to change the route she chose. This is the reality she is forced to live with in the aftermath of her wedding and through the years of her marriage to Min, during which Soo-ja goes through a lot of suffering. It doesn&#8217;t help that she continually ends up crossing paths with Yul, and even when their chance encounters are years and years apart, the pain and regret only ever intensify. I was completely caught up in the story &#8212; I seriously could not put it down, and there were so many moments that were so beautiful and yet so unbelievably sad that I often felt like the author was deliberately crushing my heart in his fist. You want a love triangle? This is the real deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about Soo-ja as a heroine is that, even though she made this huge mistake, I still loved her. She pays tenfold for that one momentous choice, but she never lets it break her. Instead, she picks up the pieces and builds herself back up again, better and stronger every time. Sometimes, it requires more strength to stay and endure than to pull away and leave it all behind. It takes even more willpower to keep your head held high, which Soo-ja manages to do, all the while remaining tied to a selfish man and a demoralizing, bitter marriage. She owns up to her mistake, and she faces the consequences, even when doing so is the equivalent of a bitter pill. I admired her and wanted the best for her. I didn&#8217;t envy Soo-ja&#8217;s terrible situation, but couldn&#8217;t help wishing I possessed even the smallest fraction of her willpower. She carries this novel with elegance, even in its darkest moments.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s seriously so hard for me to articulate my love for this novel and the story it tells. I get all tongue-tied when it comes to books like this, books that stay in my heart and never leave it. I couldn&#8217;t recommend it more. <em>This Burns My Heart</em> asks difficult questions about the chances we don&#8217;t take. It&#8217;s a story about the choices we make and what we have to give up in exchange. And it&#8217;s a story of unrequited love, but also the kind of love that stays with you, refusing to let go.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Daisy Whitney</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Little, Brown &amp; Company; Hardcover &#8211; 288 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>&#8220;At the end of my life, when I&#8217;m looking back, will I regret not doing this?&#8221;</em> It&#8217;s a question Danny&#8217;s mother used to ask all the time, usually just before doing something like pulling him out of school to go surfing all day &#8212; just because. Now, in the wake of her death, Danny finds himself asking the same question, along with a thousand others. Why did his mother have to die just months before his graduation, after hanging on a full five years in an effort to be there for her son&#8217;s valedictory speech? Danny feels both bereft and overwhelmed. So when a letter arrives from Tokyo discussing the apartment his mother left him in her will, he decides that he would rather not have any regrets. Searching for remnants of his mother&#8217;s memory in quiet temples and secluded teahouses, Danny begins to realize that the way she lived matters more than how she died.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, what?? I&#8217;m reading contemporary again?? Okay, everyone take deep breaths and some chill pills. Everything is okay. The world is not ending. I&#8217;m just enjoying a summer of reading a genre I normally don&#8217;t like very much, and it&#8217;s turning out to be a summer of pleasant surprises as well. While this book didn&#8217;t elicit the same massive, gut-wrenching feels I&#8217;m seeing other bloggers confessing to, I still walked away from it with an aching heart. It&#8217;s hard not to. <em>When You Were Here</em> deals with the deepest kind of grief, the kind that changes you forever. Even more than that, it&#8217;s a story about living &#8212; how much it hurts, how much joy it brings, and how to keep on going when you&#8217;re the one left behind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2657"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to say, I really like having a guy narrator now and then. It switches things up a little. Plus it&#8217;s always interesting to see things from a male perspective because, as a girl, I&#8217;m already pretty well-versed in the opposite side of the spectrum. Danny is still reeling from the loss of his mother, who recently lost her battle with cancer just months before his high school graduation. There are some very strong, very painful emotions hitting you in the face from the very beginning, but what I came to love about Danny was the fact that he wasn&#8217;t the troubled, reckless guy he appeared to be at first glance. Through all the various flashbacks and memories that he relives, it&#8217;s easy to see what a good heart he has. This is a boy who rescues spiders, who used to steal lilacs from the neighbor&#8217;s garden because his mother loved them best. It doesn&#8217;t matter that we first meet him while he&#8217;s busy ramming his car into someone else&#8217;s out of sheer rage and pure grief. That boy isn&#8217;t the real Danny. I really, really enjoyed getting to know the person underneath all that anger and sadness. He was someone worth knowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved that Danny made the decision to travel to Japan in search of closure &#8212; I loved his connection with the country, his love for its culture and its people, and I loved the experiences he had while he was there. It was a journey of self-discovery as well as a journey into memories lost and found. Even more than the setting, I grew attached to Danny&#8217;s tour guide and newfound friend Kana, who carries a panda purse and wears the most outrageously awesome clothing ever seen on this planet. Her personality was so much fun. My only complaint about her was that she fit into her role of &#8220;answer girl&#8221; a little too well; she says the right things, gives the right advice, and provides the support that Danny needs, but at times it seemed a bit too convenient. I kind of wish it had been more of an even exchange. Still, my affection for Kana outweighed my mild annoyance with her character&#8217;s role in the story.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What really bugged me about <em>When You Were Here</em> was Holland. I know I was probably supposed to like her, even sympathize with her, but in the end I just couldn&#8217;t completely like her as a person. It&#8217;s hard to put my finger on exactly why because she&#8217;s not unpleasant in any way. Actually, she&#8217;s got a lot of good things about Holland, and it&#8217;s simple enough to see why Danny cares so much about her. She&#8217;s funny, warm, as comfortable as an old sweater&#8230; but I just could NOT get over this one huge decision/mistake that she made. I can&#8217;t talk about it because it&#8217;s a terrible spoiler and I wouldn&#8217;t do that to you, but man. Just, no. NO. I couldn&#8217;t believe what she&#8217;d done and even after hearing her explanation, I still wasn&#8217;t sold. It just struck me as completely incomprehensible, not to mention unfair, and I was actually relieved when Danny didn&#8217;t forgive her right away either. In fact, I was relieved when he got mad about it, and mad at everyone who helped Holland, because I felt like he had every right to feel that way. Ugh, I still feel that way right now, thinking about what she did! It was ridiculous. I get that she was terrified out of her mind and unable to think coherently, but I&#8217;m upset with her anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lot of other bloggers out there were utterly floored by the emotions in this book, but while I was certainly pretty affected by all those emotions, they didn&#8217;t devastate me on the same level as <em>If I Stay</em>. I think this had a lot to do with how much of Danny&#8217;s story centers around what is bright and beautiful about life, even though there is a lot of sorrow in the events that surround it. I was more affected by the positive stuff in this book than the heartbreak it comes with. I didn&#8217;t tear up until the near the very end, and I can&#8217;t talk about that either!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I struggled with the rating for this book because, while I liked it SO MUCH and came away with a lot of deep thoughts to ponder, there were some flaws I have to subtract stars for. There were times when characters were a bit too conveniently aligned with their roles, Holland was pretty obviously engineered to be extremely likeable, and sometimes it felt like Danny was circling the same questions and answers over and over again. BUT: I loved the way the story peeled away by layers, so that I learned who Danny truly was deep down, beyond his grief. I loved the message of hope and healing that this book imparts. So really it feels more like a 3.8888 rating to me, and I DO recommend that you read it, especially if you already love the contemporary genre.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2006, Viking Juvenile &#8211; Hardcover, 383 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annabel was the girl who had everything &#8212; a loving family, a dazzling best friend, popularity. But things have changed, and now she&#8217;s an outsider, watching her former best friend Sophie tear her reputation to shreds and walking on eggshells at home while her sister slowly recovers from an eating disorder. There are so many things Annabel wants to say, so many truths to tell, but it seems like no one is listening&#8230; not even Annabel herself. When she strikes up an unexpected friendship with fellow outsider Owen Armstrong, every day becomes a lesson on what it means to tell the truth, as well as how to face it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you were wondering whether my Dessen binge had finally ended or not, here&#8217;s your answer: nope! Still working through her entire bibliography like a madwoman, and <em>Just Listen</em> is definitely one of my absolute favorites from her so far. Like <a title="Lock &amp; Key" href="http://novelideareviews.com/lock-key/" target="_blank"><em>Lock &amp; Key</em></a>, this one deals with some tough issues. Sarah Dessen handles it with her usual touch for making these issues relevant and realistically portrayed. Annabel&#8217;s story covers toxic friendships, bullying, &#8216;mean girls&#8217; and eating disorders, as well as the struggles of getting through a family crisis and how hard it is to be completely honest, with others and with yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2632"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to start with Owen, because I love him. I just do. I can&#8217;t even explain it coherently. Like other Dessen boys, he&#8217;s got a history that he isn&#8217;t proud of, and most people give him a pretty wide berth. I&#8217;ve always liked that Sarah Dessen&#8217;s characters are more than what they seem on the outside, which is a big theme in this book especially. Owen believes in not judging, in always telling the truth, which is partly due to mistakes he&#8217;s made in the past. This is in sharp contrast to Annabel, who has a policy of holding everything in rather than telling people how she really feels. I loved Owen&#8217;s unflinching dedication to always telling the truth, no matter how much that truth will hurt, and no matter how difficult it is to do it. He makes a good case for honesty. How many hurtful situations could be avoided just by telling the truth? How much do we withhold from the people in our lives because we&#8217;re afraid of the consequences? Just Listen explores the nature of lies, whether they&#8217;re white lies or full blown deceptions. Owen&#8217;s personal crusade to be honest with his own feelings and opinions is exactly what Annabel needs, but also what she fears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I mentioned earlier, <em>Just Listen</em> deals with toxic friendships &#8212; specifically, recovering from them. I really identified with this because I&#8217;ve been through it before. It made the reading experience really painful for me at times, just because remembering how you&#8217;ve been hurt is sometimes even worse than the actual experience. I know firsthand how hard it is to even acknowledge that a friendship isn&#8217;t actually good for you. And even though you know deep down that it&#8217;s for the best, it&#8217;s ten times harder to let go. Like everyone else, I haven&#8217;t always been a good friend, and I&#8217;ve made some regrettable choices in the past when it comes to my friendships. But Annabel&#8217;s situation really touched me because I know what it&#8217;s like to <em>lose</em> your best friend. I know the emptiness left behind when you let that person go. Yes, you&#8217;re better off without them, but on the other hand you&#8217;re also faced with the prospect of not having anyone to fill that role in your life. It&#8217;s a lonely place to be. I liked that Annabel eventually recognized that Sophie wasn&#8217;t what she needed, but also that there was a lot to learn and discover about herself through that relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also loved this book&#8217;s focus on music and how deeply it can be embedded in your memories, good or bad. There are some songs that always take me back to that particular place and time, that invoke all the emotions of the moment as though I&#8217;m experiencing it all over again. The power of music is a big deal in this book, and it ties in so well with Annabel&#8217;s process of learning how to <em>just listen</em>, without jumping to conclusions or shying away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Whether it was a song, a person, or a story, there was a lot you couldn&#8217;t know from just an excerpt, a glance, or part of a chorus.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to include this quote in my review because in a lot of ways, it also describes my relationship with Sarah Dessen books. I had so many misconceptions about her writing before I took the plunge and started actually reading instead of just lingering on the fringe of things. I&#8217;ll be up front with you: I&#8217;m 26 years old and I read more YA than adult fiction, which means that I often find myself frustrated with all the hormones and etc flying around in books primarily meant for teens. I won&#8217;t go into a long treatise on why I prefer YA over books that actually are meant for people my age, because that would take me off on a tangent. But what I want to say is that Dessen&#8217;s storylines and characters are NOT typical YA, at least not in my opinion. I keep picking up her books because I know now that she&#8217;s going to surprise me by being thought provoking in the most unexpected moments, about the most ordinary and everyday experiences. She talks about real problems and real emotions. Yes, her books follow a familiar format. Yes, there is usually a happy ending. But I kind of like knowing good things are coming. I like watching her characters grow, and I like <em>knowing</em> they&#8217;re going to grow and change.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a really personal connection with this book and its themes &#8212; sorry for the rambling! Honestly, there is so much I want to say about this book that I&#8217;m leaving out because I&#8217;m trying really hard not to saddle you with a 10-page essay. I highly recommend this one to current Dessen fans as well as anyone who is thinking of reading her books but isn&#8217;t sure where to start. I&#8217;d say this is my third favorite, after <em><a title="The Truth About Forever" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-truth-about-forever/" target="_blank">The Truth About Forever</a></em> and <a title="Along For the Ride" href="http://novelideareviews.com/along-for-the-ride/" target="_blank"><em>Along For the Ride</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 383 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Auden has always felt more alive at night. She escapes the confines of her quiet, scripted life and drives out into the darkness, drinking coffee in all-night diners or just feeling the wind on her face. When she decides to do something different for the summer and stay with her father, stepmother and newborn stepsister in the seaside town of Colby, Auden doesn&#8217;t expect her nocturnal existence to change. But as it turns out, she isn&#8217;t the only one who stays up all night, and despite everything she&#8217;s learned to believe, change still can happen to anyone and anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have so much love for this book. I know it&#8217;s often the case that the first book you read from an author is the most magical experience and you won&#8217;t be able to recreate it. Sort of like a law of diminishing returns, only for books. But <em>Along For the Ride</em> surprised me by quickly becoming a contender for my favorite Dessen book ever, and this is after reading four of her books within the last few weeks. If you choose <em>The Truth About Forever</em> as your first Sarah Dessen novel, make <em>Along For the Ride</em> your second.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2392"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Auden right away, I think partly because I&#8217;m a night owl too. I completely understood the appeal of those late hours between midnight and sunrise, when it really does feel like the world is different. During the day, Auden is so serious, so diligent; she&#8217;s spent her entire life trying to be the kind of girl her scholarly, extremely feminist mother might want for a daughter. Meanwhile, her father has remarried and moved to a quaint beach town in the years since the divorce, and her brother Hollis is backpacking somewhere through Europe having the time of his life. Now it&#8217;s Auden&#8217;s last summer before college, and she finds herself longing for something to change, despite her mother&#8217;s assertion that people don&#8217;t change at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best thing about Auden as a protagonist was her tendency to choose the option that I never would have expected her to take. You can tell from the synopsis that she&#8217;s going to experience a transformation, and this is a Dessen novel so you know it&#8217;s going to happen regardless, but she surprised me by being SO proactive about the process. Yes, she is reluctant, but even in her reluctance Auden is ultimately the one who instigates the changes in her life. She personally chooses to do these things that are A) outside her comfort zone or B) not at all what she even WANTS to do and the result is a legit transformation for her character. I loved that her learning experiences were self-imposed. She tries these new things without an outside force shoving her into them. Auden actively chooses her path, which means she takes most of the credit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Along For the Ride</em> also features something we don&#8217;t see enough of in YA, across all genres: examples of women working together rather than plotting against each other. Auden has never had very many friends to begin with, least of all friends who are girls. Her mother looks down on women who like pink, fluffy, frilly things because she sees this as buying into the whole feminine stereotype, and her beliefs have pretty much colored the way Auden thinks. But this novel does an amazing job of showcasing women and girls supporting one another through friendship, sisterhood and motherhood, and it also makes a strong statement that liking pink, happy, frilly things doesn&#8217;t mean your brain is made of 100% fluff. In the words of Auden&#8217;s new friend Maggie, <em><strong>&#8220;Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn&#8217;t be about the either/or. We&#8217;re capable of more than that, you know?&#8221;</strong></em> Guys, <em><strong>I love this message</strong></em>. And I love that Auden discovers the beauty of having friends you can paint your nails with, gossip about boys with, do all those fun girly things with, and yet can still have intelligent conversations with at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, as awesome as the girls are, I can&#8217;t ignore the one very important guy. (Right???) The only Dessen boy I like better than Auden&#8217;s bike-riding, late-night shopping, coffee-drinking Eli is Wes from <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, and it&#8217;s an extremely close second. They are pretty similar I think, but what made me love Eli was the fact that he surprised me as much and as often as Auden did. And he wasn&#8217;t perfect &#8212; he made mistakes just like she did, and they were both running away from things they&#8217;d rather not think about or relive ever again. But Eli challenges Auden to try what she&#8217;s never done before, and to see things from different perspectives. Plus, can I just say that I love Dessen books for proving that romance is possible WITHOUT two teenagers getting all hot and heavy all the time?? Call me old-fashioned, but I think it&#8217;s more effective, as well as refreshing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from a few snags in the plot towards the end (that made me scream at Auden while shaking my iPad and trying to will the words to fall out so I could rewrite them the way I felt things should be&#8230;), <em>Along For the Ride</em> was everything I&#8217;ve come to love about Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing, from the realistic and yet vibrant characters to the simple comfort of knowing that her stories have happy endings, no matter how complicated. It&#8217;s a light, heartwarming read that isn&#8217;t shallow. Oh, if you&#8217;ve read <em>Lock &amp; Key</em> (<a title="Lock &amp; Key" href="http://novelideareviews.com/lock-key/">which I reviewed yesterday</a>), Ruby&#8217;s key necklaces make an appearance in the store owned by Auden&#8217;s stepmother :) AND, if you&#8217;ve read <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, you&#8217;ll have to laugh while reading this because JASON TALBOT STRIKES AGAIN haha!!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 283 Pages (2008)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby knows how to fend for herself. After all, she&#8217;s been doing that for the past few months. Scraping a living together from her after school job, living alone in the little yellow house she used to share with her mother, she finally has a degree of independence. But the show is over, because her mother is missing and now Ruby&#8217;s estranged sister has reappeared in her life after years of not being there when they needed each other the most. Cora and her husband Jamie take Ruby back with them to their palatial home in the suburbs, enroll her in a prestigious private school, and seem determined to give her everything she lacked throughout her childhood. But why is living the easy life so much harder than getting by on her own?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby, the product of a brokenÂ  home and a single parent who isn&#8217;t much of a parent at all, is an entire world removed from the protagonist of <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, which was my first ever Sarah Dessen book. While Macy has a roof over her head, money in the bank and a pretty secure existence, Ruby has had to cope with abuse and neglect. When her sister whisks her away from what she knows, it&#8217;s like being relocated to an alien planet. <em>Lock and Key</em> deals with some tougher issues than I&#8217;ve seen so far in this author&#8217;s work, and while it had some flaws, I still think it handled those difficult topics very well, and that it ended with a familiar sense of hope that is iconic of Dessen&#8217;s books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2259"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, I have to mention that I love the way Sarah Dessen writes standalone novels that are still set in the same universe, so we get to catch glimpses of characters from other books (and wildly wave to them, if you&#8217;re a massive nerd like me) and get that extra little boost of comfort and familiarity. If you&#8217;ve read <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, some of Macy&#8217;s co-workers from Wish make a cameo appearance and it all takes place in the same neighborhood so Ruby&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law actually live in a neighborhood designed by Macy&#8217;s parents. I personally really like little details like this. It&#8217;s a lot like running into someone you know after years of not seeing each other, and having this resurgence of good memories from the last time you met. I enjoy seeing how all these different characters, with all their different stories and situations, can still be subtly connected to one another even in the smallest ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby wasn&#8217;t as endearing to me as Macy was, though I can&#8217;t put my finger on just why. I did admire her strength and her courage, and I did appreciate that she was this really tough girl having to learn how to trust others instead of alienate herself from them. I guess I just didn&#8217;t bond with her in the same way I bonded with Macy, who was slightly more accessible as a character. I did love Nate and thought he was pretty well-written; he surprised me several times, and his personality was just the thing Ruby needed to offset her own. The supporting cast, especially Ruby&#8217;s brother-in-law Jamie, were also wonderful and as memorable as I expected them to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I feel this book does best is portraying the fact that there are many different kinds of abuse. It doesn&#8217;t have to be physical. In Ruby&#8217;s case, she suffered from a neglectful parent even more than a physically violent one. One of the characters also deals with verbal abuse and neglect of a different kind, because a parent can still pay attention to their child, but in all the wrong ways&#8230; which is still neglecting their needs. Both Nate and Ruby are products of divorce, and you are able to see two different ways in which divorce affects children. I think these tough issues resonated with me more than Ruby did because as a teacher I&#8217;ve unfortunately seen a lot of this in my classroom. It&#8217;s saddening, but also makes me want to do something to help, and I liked that the characters strive to help one another &#8212; I especially like that they learn to reach out to others for that help instead of constantly internalizing or trying to deal with things on their own. So, I&#8217;d like to give the author props for handling sensitive subjects well and not trying to sugarcoat them or disguise them as something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing <em>Lock &amp; Key</em> accomplishes is an exploration of the different shades of being a family and the true definition of that word. Ruby struggles with this concept for the majority of the book, slowly learning what family means and how to accept the family that she has. Dealing with trust and abandonment issues makes this an uphill battle for her, but it was something that I found really heartening to watch unfold. There are so many different kinds of families, and not everyone in your family needs to be bound to you by blood. Friends are family too, and even broken families are still families. I was especially touched by Ruby&#8217;s relationship with her sister Cora because I&#8217;m a sister myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn&#8217;t have very many problems with the story, though I did think it was more predictable than <em>The Truth About Forever</em>. I thought Ruby and Nate&#8217;s private school, Perkins Day, was a little bit too utopian and therefore rather unrealistic, but it wasn&#8217;t something that I couldn&#8217;t relegate to the background while I focused on the characters and their growth instead. My other problem was with the resolution of things with Nate, which felt kind of unsatisfying to me but at the same time was appropriate in a lot of ways, so I couldn&#8217;t rail against it as much as I wanted to. I mean, the way things went with him made a lot of sense, even if it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to happen, and I can accept that. I guess. Maybe. LOL.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Dessen offering takes us through darker territory than most of her books, with a protagonist that has to pick up the pieces after a lifetime of abuse and instability. But it&#8217;s also infused with strong messages about breaking the cycle of abuse, as well as the meaning of family, and how the ties we forge with other people have so much power to help and to heal.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 376 Pages (2004)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pursuit of perfection is something Macy knows by heart. She strives to be the perfect student, the perfect girlfriend, the perfect daughter, to the point that she can barely remember who the real girl is underneath. Deep inside, the real Macy is weighted with guilt and regret, still grieving in the wake of her father&#8217;s death and feeling disconnected from everyone and everything. But this is the summer when Macy will learn to let go &#8212; to be her true self, and to live fearlessly, despite how unpredictable and imperfect life can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So! This was my first ever Sarah Dessen book, recommended to me by the lovely Ana at <a href="http://t.co/cQarM2mD3s" target="_blank"><em>Anahera Reads</em></a> when I was looking around for a good YA Contemporary for this event. I have to admit that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to try this author&#8217;s books for YEARS. I came in half expecting something insubstantial and/or hormonal to the extreme, but my perceptions were completely changed by the time I turned the last page. Well, long before that, actually. The fact that I loved this book so much is kind of crazy, because I am definitely not a big contemporary reader, and definitely not in the YA genre. I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I find it hard to enjoy contemporary books because they just don&#8217;t seem like enough of an escape for me, but I am now making an exception for Sarah Dessen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; Actually, this book kind of sent me on a crazy Dessen binge. I HAVE NO REGRETS. <em>The Truth About Forever</em> surprised me with its candid look at grief, the vibrance and believability of its characters, and the small, poignant moments that I still haven&#8217;t forgotten even weeks after reading it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2243"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love this book for its realistic take on what being a teenager is like. Since I read a lot of YA, the average age range is anywhere between 15-19 years old, and not every book has a believable take on being that age. Maybe my own experience with being in high school was the most grossly unexciting thing ever, but sometimes I run into teenaged characters who do things or live these lifestyles that seem so farfetched. Macy, however, is someone you can easily accept as being 17 years old, in that final summer before senior year and dealing with issues that are both relevant and understandable. Grief is such a powerful force, and it has shaped the way she&#8217;s been living her life. She was a character I sympathized with, but also a character I wanted to hug REALLY HARD. I liked her immediately. And I was thrilled to see that the teenagers in this book weren&#8217;t living this constant dramafest 24/7, with hookups and breakups and some new *disaster* every 5 minutes. They were just ordinary people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I think it would be pretty accurate to say that it&#8217;s the art of finding meaning in the ordinary and the everyday that makes Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing so easy to enjoy and identify with. I&#8217;m figuring that out with every Dessen book I read. Her stories are warm and inviting, but not superficial in any way. And the thing is, even though reading this book was a lot like watching a feel-good movie, and even though some things were predictable in the way feel-good movies usually are, I didn&#8217;t care. I liked it anyway. It was comforting, a lot like sitting down at Starbucks with an old friend and just talking for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Wes. I <em>loved</em> Wes. I loved the entire cast, really. Minus Jason, but you aren&#8217;t really supposed to love him, and I mostly felt sorry for the guy. The book is full of people you can&#8217;t help liking. They&#8217;re funny, memorable, and have really distinct personalities. Their interactions and relationships with one another were so natural. The writer has a gift for creating characters you could easily picture living next door, waving to you from their driveway, and she even makes you wish you could really wave back.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Truth About Forever</em> is the story of one summer, with all its small joys and sorrows. It&#8217;s the little things that all add up to a bigger picture, for Macy and for the reader. It made me smile, but it also made me think, and because of that I decided I was okay with the story being a bit predictable. After all, there&#8217;s something about knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going and how to get there, and sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a book hold your hand and make you feel like you&#8217;re home. I highly recommend it, and Sarah Dessen in general, whether you&#8217;re a big fan of contemporary or a stranger to it like I was.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Katja Millay</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Contemporary YA</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Ebook, 448 Pages (Atria Books)</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">Former piano prodigy Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone learning about her past and to make the boy who took everything from herâher identity, her spirit, her will to liveâpay.</span><br />
Josh Bennettâs story is no secret: every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.</p>
<p>Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and wonât go away until sheâs insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets sheâs been hidingâor if he even wants to. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16151178-the-sea-of-tranquility" target="_blank">from Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is aÂ beautiful, heartbreaking, gut wrenching, haunting, dark and hopeful novel. I finished it about a week ago (after reading it in one sitting!), and the emotions it caused in me still feel fresh and truthfully I am still processing them. Can you tell I loved it? Because I think saying I loved this book is an understatement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya Kashinkov is a strong but broken teenager. Hoping to escape her past, she moves in with her aunt and starts at a new school. But she isn&#8217;t the daughter and niece her family remembers: she&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t spoken in over a year and dresses as inÂ provocativeÂ manner (she calls it her &#8220;russian whore&#8221; look). Right from the novels start, we&#8217;re made aware that something horrific has happened to Nastya, she was a piano prodigy but is no longer, she has died and been brought back to life (but not to who she was). Nastya story&#8217;s isÂ purposelyÂ revealed in a slow manner and in works. I&#8217;m not usually a fan of slow reveals but in this case, it was done so well and in a natural manner that is really worked for me. The story is told from the POV of Nastya and Josh, something that works incredibly well here. I really enjoyed getting each character&#8217;s perspective and in the case of Nastya, it showed the duality of just how strong she is while also being deeply affected by the past events.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya as a character is depressing but also amazing. She clearly suffering from the result of a traumatic event: she chooses not to speak, to beÂ invisibleÂ yet also puts herself out there in aÂ confrontationalÂ manner with how she dresses. She could have easily become the clichÃ©d emo character but she isn&#8217;t at all. Her innerÂ monologueÂ gives you the insight into how she doesn&#8217;t want to be this person yet doesn&#8217;t know how to be who she was. She doesn&#8217;t want to hurt people and yet she feels like she always is. Â She feels like she can&#8217;t be saved and yet you know that she wants to be. I felt her pain, even before the revelation of what happened to her was done (in aÂ trulyÂ hard to read in that fantastic kind of way). There were times when I wanted to shake her and make her do things differently, but it was in that way you want to do when you care about someone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Josh Bennett, the other lead of the story and Nastya&#8217;s love interest, is an equally broken character, albeit in a different. Everyone is Josh&#8217;s life has left him and now he just wants to shut down and be invisible. But that changes with the arrival of Nastya. The dynamic between Josh and Nastya is captivating. The give and take, push and pull, had me turning page after page. I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of them. And this went beyond just them falling for each other. Their romance is perfect in that imperfect kind of way but what I loved the most was that at the core of their relationship was an understanding of each other&#8217;s pain that one else could. Josh doesn&#8217;t save Nastya and Nastya doesn&#8217;t save Josh but rather Â knowing each other brings them to a place where they want to change and heal their pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TheÂ surroundingÂ cast are also wellÂ developedÂ and interesting. I loved the dynamic between Nastya and Josh&#8217;s best friend Drew. Their own relationship and Drew&#8217;s character are both given the time and importance to beÂ developedÂ and explored. None of the characters in the story felt like throwaway orÂ place-fillers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll say it again, the story is beautifully written. It is a time a very dark novel, the hinted to events thatÂ occurredÂ to Nastya are disturbing and they way her post-traumatic stress manifest itself is hard to read at time. But the magic ofÂ <em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is that this is so well done that youÂ sympathizeÂ and cheer for the characters. The pitfalls of the &#8220;emo&#8221; broken girl are pretty much avoided. The writing is by far some of the best I&#8217;ve read (and not just in the YA genre).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both these characters are damaged people, you understand why they turn away from the world the way they do and yet with each other, they find the hope needed to break free of the darkness. It&#8217;s truly beautiful story telling.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is amazing story telling that affects you to your core. Nastya and Josh are wonderful, real characters. I cannot praise this book enough! Definitely pick up a copy of it if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>A huge thank you toÂ Atria Books for making this book available for review via NetGalley.</p>

<p>As a teenager, Rob Carrey was a champion sculler and was offered the opportunity to attended Felton, an elite boarding school with a famous rowing team. Once there, Rob clashes with hisÂ privilegedÂ schoolmates andÂ reluctantlyÂ joins the elite 5 person crew known as the God Four. Now an adult andÂ on a flight home after working on a documentary in South Africa, Rob finds a letter in his mail from an old classmate and crew member talking about their year at Felton and asking Rob to come to their reunion. The letter triggers memories of thatÂ faithfulÂ year which took aÂ tragicÂ turn. C<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">onfronted with his past and realizing just how uncertain his future is, Rob is forced to deal with the trauma of his past and the current turmoil he faces in life.</span></p>
<p>I found the story to be very slow moving. It was clear that the slow placing was intentional and I felt like it made the reader forced to focus more on the characters and their relationships then the mystery of what happened at Felton all those years ago. The language and descriptions were beautiful. I really felt like I could picture Felton and the river as much as Caroline&#8217;s loft. I found that the book did a good job of moving between Rob&#8217;s storyline from the present with that in the past. I enjoyed how it matched the feelings and parelled situations that were going on at both those times in his life. I don&#8217;t know much about rowing but I felt like the book did a good job ofÂ explainingÂ it, not just technically but also the drive that leads people to row and the sacrifices they make to do this sport.<br />
<span id="more-2048"></span><br />
The characters are all very complexed, this felt very much like a character driven novel to me. The story does a great job at slowly revealing and explaining why Rob, Connor, Ruth, Jumbo, Wads and Caroline are all so damaged (because yes, this is a book about very damaged people). I did enjoy how the story slowly revealed what led to these characters being the way they are. The focus of the story was mostly on Rob and Connor at Felton and Rob and Caroline in the present, but I still got a sense of who theÂ surroundingÂ cast was and why.Â You feel the pain of these characters, you understand why they are the way they (even if you don&#8217;t sympathize with them).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story and Rob still weren&#8217;t able to completely draw me in. I was interested but not captivated and ended up at times wishing the story moved more quickly. The story was just too slow for me. I didn&#8217;t mind the dark tone of the novel but that combined with the slow moving story felt too heavy for me. I also had wished that we had been given a little more at the end.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re a fan of character novels that slowlyÂ revealÂ themselves and their story, thenÂ <em>Flat Water TuesdayÂ </em>is a book for you!</p>
