<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-73884089-e18a-b3bc-d12e-83ce9f8c4ecc" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Guess what time of the year it is? Itâsâ¦.. NOVEMBER! And that meansâ¦.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: â¦ NaNoWriMo! Or, <a href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>, in case you arenât familiar with the crazy 30 days of the year when aspiring writers try to write a 50k novel in one month. <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte </a>and I are both participating this year, and we wanted to reach out to others who might be doing the same thing. (You know, all the other crazy people.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: (Doing all these crazy things haha) Basically our support group is not just limited to bloggers, weâre inviting all bookish people to participate! So you can either just make blog posts, discuss and chat in our GR group and so on! The whole point of our support group is to provide well literally, support to all fellow writers out there attempting NaNoWriMo this year and to help you get through those gruelling 30 days!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Weâll be here for you through whatever youâre going through in your writing adventures (err, or misadventuresâ¦) and we hope the support group will become a fun community where you can talk about your project, get constructive criticism and inspiration, or just hang out when you feel like your brain is about to explode.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Weâve got your back in November ;) Youâre not alone in this, Writers Unite!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3992"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: <em><strong>To sign up, just <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">fill out the form</a> to be added to the list of participants.</strong></em> We also have a group on Goodreads specifically for the event; youâll find the link at the end of the <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">sign-up form</a>! Once youâve done this, you have until the end of October to write up an intro post.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: <em><strong>For your intro post, tell us a little bit about yourselves and your NaNo experience &#8211; have you participated before? Is this your first time? Any challenges you think youâll face? What are your goals? And if you feel comfortable sharing with us, maybe the synopsis of your novel or the title :)</strong></em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: You can write your intro post any time before November 1st and add it to our linky list on <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/writers-unite-participant-list/" target="_blank">the participants page</a> over here! We also have a <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/2013/10/writers-unite-intro-post/" target="_blank">sample intro post</a> from Charlotte if you need inspiration.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the event weâll be posting about our progress once a week, and we hope you will too! Bloggers and non-bloggers can participate in this; if you donât have a blog, weâll have a thread in the Goodreads group where you can talk about how youâre doing. Also, on Wednesdays weâll be doing some fun posts to get into the writing spirit! Here are some ideas for topics you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Interview one of your characters</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Come up with a playlist for your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Do you have a writing ritual?</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>What reward you&#8217;ve got lined up when you write that 50k!</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Dream cast your novel</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Essential tools that help you write</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: The fun posts are optional so donât feel pressurised to make sure you get a post up every Wednesday. If youâre going through Writerâs Block or need to just write something else apart from your novel, these posts can be a great help!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: That&#8217;s it! <strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/writers-unite-sign-up-form/ " target="_blank">Sign up on the form</a>, get your <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/2013/10/writers-unite-intro-post/" target="_blank">intro post</a> written, <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/writers-unite-participant-list/" target="_blank">link it up here</a>, and also check out the tentative schedule for the event</strong>.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Unlike my experience actually reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> for the first time, the story behind how I discovered the book isn&#8217;t at all exciting. I devour fantasy books on a regular basis and I&#8217;m always looking for my next escape, which is what led me to Lumatere. I remember skimming through a few reviews on Goodreads and finding myself compelled by the sheer amount of people who were rendered incoherent and/or speechless by this book. This got me thinking that I should probably pick it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="finnpost01" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/finnpost01-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></strong>Some 400 pages later, I realized this had been one of the best literary moments of my life. EVER. But I&#8217;d packed my bags and applied for permanent citizenship long before that. Maybe it was the first time Evanjalin rolled her eyes at Finnikin. (And all the subsequent times hahaha) Maybe it was every single time these characters kept going, never giving up on the home they&#8217;d been forced to leave behind. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on when it happened exactly, but somewhere on that journey I decided I belonged there too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3909"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think many of us who read fantasy are drawn to the genre because A) it gives us a chance to get away to an entirely different world and/or B) it gives us a chance to live in a world where the epic and the legendary are still possible. Lumatere exemplifies both, for me. This is a place where there is power in every promise, where honor and loyalty still matter, where love is unbreakable. These are people who do absolutely nothing by halves, whether it&#8217;s living or loving or dying. It&#8217;s where friendship is a bond that lasts forever, where I&#8217;ve witnessed every possible way to be brave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It never ceases to amaze. Melina Marchetta is capable of rendering me into a sobbing, laughing, inarticulate mess with only one sentence. This universe of hers even seems to be rendered in colors more vivid than the ones in our spectrum, to the point that reading this series somehow made me feel more <em>alive</em>. And I guess this feeling just makes me want to take this book and give it to everyone I meet. I just want you to see what I see. I want you to experience this crazy, crushing, heartbreaking, exhilarating, BEAUTIFUL feeling. It&#8217;s why I came to Lumatere and never left.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hello again, and welcome to <strong>Part III</strong> of Paola&#8217;s translation of <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen (for the Austen-Challenged!) as part of our participation in <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a>! If you missed the other two installments of these shenanigans, here&#8217;s <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank">Part I</a> (introduction + chapters 1-7) and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank">Part II</a> (chapters 8-12).</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">PERSUASION: PART II</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapters One &amp; Two</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne finally ends her forever long stay at Uppercross with the Musgroves and departs with her old chum (and supplier of the world&#8217;s worst advice) Lady Russell. But of course it&#8217;s a small, small world so she eventually sees the Musgroves again in Lyme. It is revealed that Benwick, Prince of Emo, has been asking about Anne. Also revealed: Anne&#8217;s crybaby hypochondriac sister Mary is still a massive jerk. Another new development is Cousin Elliott&#8217;s interest in suddenly reconciling with the rest of his family after alternating between ignoring and slandering them for the past few years. He&#8217;s been sighted in Bath, being a lurking lurker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3677"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Time for a new brand of misery as Anne reluctantly joins Sir Walter (King of the Douchebags) and Elizabeth (Queen of the Douchebags) at the Elliotts&#8217; townhouse in Bath. Mrs. Clay, suspected gold digger, is still living at Camden Place with them. Bath is not Anne&#8217;s favorite place in the world, so of course the rest of her awful family absolutely loves it. Sir W and Elizabeth are obsessed with Cousin Elliott, conveniently forgiving all of his past sins now that he&#8217;s dedicated to being BFFs with them again. Anne has her misgivings about Cousin Elliott as well as Mrs. Clay, not that anyone is listening. She wonders if Cousin Elliott is interested in patching things up because he&#8217;s reconsidering marrying Elizabeth. Meanwhile, our wonderful Sir Walter spends some time lamenting the general ugliness of everyone else who lives in Bath.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an interesting turn of events, Cousin Elliott pays a visit to Camden Place and realizes that Anne is, in fact, that cute girl he saw at the beach in Lyme not long ago. Anne is surprised to find that her first evening in Bath is less miserable than what she was expecting. Still miserable, but not AS miserable, anyway.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne continues being the only one worried about Cousin Elliott&#8217;s intentions re: Elizabeth and Mrs. Clay&#8217;s gold digging schemes re: Sir Walter. Lady Russell seems to have shelved most of her worries, although she is still of the opinion that Mrs. Clay is a shameless social climber. The more superficial and pretentious members of the Elliott clan go into full freak out mode over the impending arrival of distant relations Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, who are nobility. Relations between the Elliotts and Dalrymples have been strained since the death of Lady Elliott ages ago, but in the end the fences are mended and Anne gets to listen to her father and sister fawning over them day and night. Cousin Elliott is not as disgusted by their behavior as Anne, sneakily pointing out that at least hanging out with the Dalrymples distracts Sir Walter from any possibility of interaction (or, grossly enough, falling in love) with Mrs. Clay.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now that she&#8217;s living in Bath, Anne decides to track down her former governess, Mrs. Smith. Poor Mrs. Smith is now both destitute and a cripple, but still a lovely person. Definitely better company than what Anne has to deal with at Camden Place. They have many a long talk after not seeing each other for so long. Anne admires Mrs. Smith&#8217;s ability to remain hopeful despite the tidal wave of horrible luck that destroyed her life in recent years. Of course, because Anne likes Mrs. Smith, her father and sister do not. Who didn&#8217;t see that coming?? We are treated to a rank from Sir W about his hatred of low-ranked widows and Mrs. Clay leaves the room before he can realize that he is in the presence of a low-ranked widow. /awkward</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cousin Elliott continues to express that he thinks Anne is awesome. Anne is weirded out because honestly, when does anyone ever say she&#8217;s awesome?? Or even acknowledges her presence at all?? Lady Russell believes that Cousin E may have romantic intentions towards Anne, perhaps with plans to pursue her rather than Elizabeth. She is thrilled. Anne is not. She tells Lady R as much, but leaves out the part where she obviously still suffers from Wentworth Fever like all the rest of us. (WENTWORTH I MISS YOU PLEASE COME BACK INTO THE STORY SOON)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This chapter opens with a nice, whiny letter from Mary &#8212; oh joy. That&#8217;s what you wanted to start off with, right? Appended to Mary&#8217;s usual Tales of Hypochondria and general lamentations as to how everyone else has a more awesome life than she does, we are given the news that Louisa is finally recovered and back at Uppercross&#8230; AND BENWICK IS IN LOVE WITH HER! Mary takes some time to gloat about how she was totally right that Benwick wasn&#8217;t ever interested in Anne at all; I take some time to stare at the page and then write &#8220;WHAT!!! GAMECHANGER!!!&#8221; in my notes. Aside from Mary being her usual tacky self, Anne is very pleased with the letter. She is happy for Benwick and Louisa. In place of our scheduled rant from Sir Walter, we get to hear Elizabeth say some rather uncharitable things about sailors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While on a walk through the charming streets of Bath, Anne encounters none other than Admiral Croft, now the family&#8217;s tenant at Kellynch Hall and one of her favorite people. Admiral Croft is deep in a conversation with himself in which he criticizes a painting of a ship in a shop window, which he thinks is all wrong. When he realizes that Anne is there, he invites her for a walk and they discuss the crazy news that Louisa and Benwick are now engaged. Amusingly enough, Anne is the only person in the world who thinks these two are meant to be with each other; everyone else is like WHAT!!!! GAMECHANGER!!! The topic of Louisa naturally ends up leading Admiral Croft to the related topic of Wentworth. He suggests that they invite Wentworth to visit them in Bath&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">TO BE CONTINUED</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The final installment of my epic <em>Persuasion</em> recap will be posted tomorrow! Until then, let the Wentworth Fever burn~ In the meantime, be sure to check out <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion: the movie" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-movie/" target="_blank">Alix&#8217;s post</a> on the 1995 film adaptation of <em>Persuasion</em>!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Also tomorrow: you&#8217;ll have a chance to tell me which Austen classic I should <del>butcher</del> recap for you next! *ominous music*</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="photo_3" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a>So for <a title="Recap: Crown of Midnight Launch (Or, EEEEK)" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-crown-of-midnight-launch-or-eeeek/">my first ever author event</a>, I drove 3 hours and 40 minutes to LA for the <em>Crown of Midnight</em> launch party (also lovingly referred to around here as <em>The Explosion of Sarah Maas Fangirl Feels</em> and <em>The Time <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Charlene</a> &amp; I Turned the Entire Event Into a Melina Marchetta Flailing Session</em>) and I had a BLAST. This time, however, I only had to drive 15 minutes to the Barnes &amp; Noble near my house for the first stop on the <a href="http://www.pitchdark.com/blog/dark-days-fall-2013/" target="_blank"><strong>Fall 2013 Dark Days Tour</strong></a>! Which, of course, was an incredible experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see from this lovely poster I picked up at the bookstore, the authors on tour were special guest Tera Lynn Childs (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10429067-sweet-venom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sweet Venom</em></a>), Madeleine Roux (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597728-asylum?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Asylum</em></a>), Rae Carson (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11431896-the-bitter-kingdom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Bitter Kingdom</em></a>), Michelle Gagnon (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>), Mindy McGinnis (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13112869-not-a-drop-to-drink?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Not A Drop To Drink</em></a>) and Sherry Thomas (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332556-the-burning-sky?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The Burning Sky</em></a>). I was mainly there to fangirl incessantly over Sherry Thomas because I&#8217;d just finished reading her book on Tuesday and still hadn&#8217;t fully recovered from the awesome. I think meeting her only caused a relapse and now all I want to do is read it again, actually. You can hear me gush over it in my review <a title="The Burning Sky" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-burning-sky/">over here</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kick the event off, the authors all took some time to tell the audience about their book. Everyone volunteered Sherry Thomas to go first, so of course she completely proves my theory that we&#8217;re kindred spirits by announcing, &#8220;My book is about cross-dressing.&#8221; Which it is!!! I&#8217;m in the audience like, YES!!! *squeaking with joy*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3771"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She went on to clarify that <em>The Burning Sky</em> features a girl who dresses as a boy at Eton College in the 1800&#8242;s. She explained that she wanted to write a book that sort of had a Harry Potter vibe, but that of course the whole &#8220;magical school&#8221; thing had already been done, so she decided to go at it from a different angle. While brainstorming, she realized that in the 1800&#8242;s the only prestigious schools were for boys, which set her protagonist Iolanthe on the cross-dressing path. She compared her hero Prince Titus to Morpheus from <em>The Matrix</em> films because he&#8217;s known forever that his task is to prepare The One for her epic quest&#8230; except that in this case, her &#8220;Morpheus&#8221; discovers that &#8220;Neo&#8221; is in fact a girl. At this point I&#8217;m just giggling with glee and clutching my copy of her book to my chest cause I want to hug it forever. LOL.</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3782 alignright" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rae Carson, who just released the final installment of her <em>Girl of Fire &amp; Thorns</em> series, described her books as being full of travel, epic battles, more travel, awesome navel bling, and not your typical &#8220;skinny&#8221; heroine. Mindy McGinnis cracked me up by summing up <em>Not A Drop To Drink</em> as, &#8220;The Hunger Games meets <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, except wearing pants, and with NO unicorns or rainbows.&#8221; Um, obviously I need to read this. SOLD!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel was asked about the research they did for their books, and Michelle Gagnon shared that she actually had a real hacker go through her books to make sure everything was legit. I thought this was rather amazing. Mindy McGinnis revealed that she lives pretty much the way her main character lives; Rae Carson at this point quipped that Mindy, &#8220;shoots people from her roof.&#8221; LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Madeleine Roux, whose book takes place in a renovated asylum, talked about the often disturbing experience of going through tons and tons of photos from asylums over the course of writing. Tera Lynn Childs went to San Francisco for week-long research while writing her books &#8212; Greek mythology fans, her series is about three girls who are descended from the gorgon Medusa &#8212; and used both trips to scout out the place her characters would be living and hunting monsters in.</p>
<div id="attachment_3784" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3784" alt="photo_2" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I ran into Sara, blogger at A Nerd Girl Says, who drove 3 hours to see Rae Carson! The last time I saw her was at the Sarah Maas event, when I was the one who had driven 3 hours! Serendipity, I tell you!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of research while writing, Sherry Thomas advised that you should read and research as much as you can, but include as little of it as possible in your book. Too much research is boring! She talked about her experiences reading firsthand accounts of life at Eton College and said she could&#8217;ve gone on and on about what it&#8217;s like to be a student there BUT she took only as much as she needed to in order to set the scene for her characters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing her streak of fantastic one-liners during this panel, Sherry answered a question about snacks while writing by telling us about Deadline Cake. GUYS. DEADLINE CAKE. When her deadline comes around, she orders a 4-layer, 8-inch cake and slowly devours it over the course of a week or so. &#8220;As a meal, of course.&#8221; I DIED. CAN WE BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authors were asked if they had any fangirling experiences over other authors; Michelle Gagnon told us an embarrassing tale about meeting Stephen King and completely creeping him out! Rae Carson talked about sitting at a table across from <em>Gone Girl</em> author Gillian Flynn and trying really hard not to stare at her the entire time in pure admiration. Sherry Thomas confessed that she stalks people silently on their blogs &#8220;for their safety.&#8221; Again, I died. Not only does this woman write a book I love to death, she shares my love for cake AND is a ninja. THE END. I NEED NOTHING MORE IN THIS LIFE.</p>
<div id="attachment_3786" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 236px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3786" alt="photo_4" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me + Sherry Thomas!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the Q&amp;A with the panel, I got my books signed and squeaked my way through a conversation with Sherry Thomas when it was my turn. I asked her how she ended up going from writing romance to YA fantasy, and she replied that actually she was asked if she might want to try writing fantasy and thought it was a good idea. Yes, a very good idea, cause she totally killed it guys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I *may* have gushed like a complete moron over Prince Titus&#8230; but it&#8217;s okay cause she was like, &#8220;I LOVE HIM TOO!!&#8221; And then I got some fantastic exclusive Prince Titus trivia; apparently after she&#8217;d written the book, Sherry discovered that the name Titus actually means (okay this is not an exact quote because I was incoherent at the time due to fangirl feels), <em>&#8220;the classic Promethean hero villain who will do anything for his cause.&#8221;</em> Which is so ridiculously perfect for this character, you have no idea! I declared that this was fate. She concurred. Then I died of Awesome for the 4th or 5th time in one evening.</p>
<div id="attachment_3789" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 213px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3789 " alt="photo_2" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_21-226x300.jpg" width="203" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Dear Paola, look forward to a beautiful friendship&#8221; UM THIS IS THE SOUND OF MY DREAMS COMING TRUE??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sherry was kind enough to write the sweetest thing ever when she signed my book, AND she signed an extra copy to give away here on the blog! You lucky, lucky people! I decided that my love for <em>The Burning Sky</em> must be spread to every corner of the universe and will be giving away this signed copy PLUS a tin of homemade hand balm that Sherry made herself! I know, she just keeps getting exponentially more amazing the longer I talk about her. Seriously. So if you want to win some swag, you can enter the giveaway at the end of this post!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also got a copy of <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> by Mindy McGinnis! It was hilarious actually because when Mindy opened my book she accidentally tore the corner of the title page! But it was totally okay because now my book has a fun story behind it. I feel like the ripped page adds character. I guess she didn&#8217;t realize her own epic survivalist strength! <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_11.jpg" target="_blank">So that&#8217;s why she wrote &#8220;Oops! Sorry!&#8221; in the corner, haha.</a> I haven&#8217;t read the book yet but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. I have special swag to give away from Mindy as well, actually &#8212; watch for my review of her book in the next few weeks cause I&#8217;ll give them away then!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3787" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>I also want to point out to you guys that all the authors on the panel had these super fancy &#8220;signed by the author&#8221; stickers! Sherry made them for everyone! (What did I tell you about exponentially increasing levels of amazing??) I snapped photos of them cause I thought they were such a nice touch. Each one had their own logo specific to the author&#8217;s book. There&#8217;s a phoenix on the one for <em>The Burning Sky</em> and a drop of water for <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, ANYWAY I had a great time and just loved getting the chance to meet all these great authors! Especially Sherry Thomas. It&#8217;s so wonderful when you love an author&#8217;s book SO MUCH and then you get to meet them and you can only love them MORE. I can&#8217;t recommend her book more, truly one of my favorite 2013 releases. Want to win a signed copy?? I&#8217;m giving one away! YOU WANT THIS BOOK. TRUST ME. Because of hundreds of reasons that I am not going to elaborate on or I&#8217;ll be here rambling forever. So here&#8217;s your chance to find out for yourself!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Win a signed copy of <a title="The Burning Sky" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-burning-sky/"><em>The Burning Sky</em></a> by Sherry Thomas!</h2>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank"><strong>About Classics Retold</strong></a> | <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion/"><strong>Our Intro Post</strong></a></h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Why hello there! This is Part II of my (shenanigan-ized) chapter-by-chapter recap of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>, specifically designed with the Austen-Challenged in mind. For a complete breakdown of the important faces and places, as well as the first seven chapters, <strong><a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/">head over here to Part I</a></strong>!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-4149-aa55-843e-d0dd63d1b44d" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because there is no justice in the world, Anne is now forced to hang out with Wentworth ALL THE DAMN TIME. The Musgroves all have Wentworth Fever and are constantly inventing new dinner parties, impromptu musical performances, and other crackpot schemes to invite him over. For Anne, itâs horrible suddenly being strangers when they used to be so close. The topic of the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son Richard is brought up; he was deemed inherently useless while still alive, but magically became awesome upon dying tragically young. Wentworth was his captain at sea and gets stuck listening to Mrs. Musgrove talking about how wonderful Richard was. He seems unconvinced of this, but only Anne notices. She continues to endure while Wentworth gives her the coldest cold shoulder ever in the history of cold shoulders.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: Wentworth is the biggest grudge holder ever. True story)</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-3674"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A cousin of the Musgroves, Charles Hayter, returns to Uppercross only to discover that he is no longer the object of everyoneâs affections. Wentworth Fever <b>(AN: trademark)Â </b>rages on. Cousin Charles is rather upset by this turn of events, since he pretty much had an arrangement with Henrietta Musgrove that they would eventually marry and live happily ever after. This might still happen if anyone could get her to stop clinging to Wentworth for at least two seconds. Alas, Cousin Charles seems doomed to being ruthlessly friendzoned <strong>(AN: LOL Austen would have totally used that term had it existed back then)Â </strong>for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, Anne suffers in silence as Mary and her husband (you know, the OTHER Charles) <strong>(AN: not confusing at all)Â </strong>strike up lively discussions on which of the Misses Musgrove will end up marrying Wentworth. Mary is a horrible person and doesnât notice that this topic makes Anne want to hurl herself off the nearest cliff. And then, on a random visit, Wentworth witnesses Anne being plagued by one of her horrible nephews and handles it LIKE A BOSS. Anne marvels at his ability to wrangle disobedient children while simultaneously wondering if this /means/ anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The crazy love quadrangle between Wentworth, the Misses Musgrove, and Cousin Charles gets more intense every day. Anne, reluctant spectator, doesnât think that Wentworth is truly in love with either of the women. But she keeps this theory to herself, probably because she knows nobody ever listens to her anyway. One fine day, she gets roped into going on a forever long walk to nearby Winthrop, home of Cousin Charles. Everyone comes along, which means Anne gets to feel like the sixth or seventh wheel throughout. Yay. Louisa makes a melodramatic declaration about how sheâd rather end up dead in a carriage crash with her true love than remain at home without him <strong>(AN: even Austen had annoying tweens in her stories!)</strong>. Or something.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While the others send Henrietta down to Winthrop to un-friendzone Cousin Charles, the group splits up and Anne accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation between Wentworth and Louisa. Wentworth makes a pointed speech about happy hazelnuts and how wishy-washy people are the worst ever. Anne, guilty of once being wishy-washy, feels ten billion times worse than before. But then Louisa starts ranting about how much Mary sucks as a sister-in-law and mentions that her brother almost married Anne instead. Louisa wishes that this event had taken place, but Anne turned down the proposal. Wentworth realizes that this happened not long after she broke the engagement with him. #Gamechanger</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the Crofts come along in their carriage, Wentworth endeavors to get Anne on board so she wonât have to walk all the way back to Uppercross with the rest of the circus. âShe understood him. He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling.â Or maybe he realized what a colossal jerk he was being and decided to take a break from that gig for a while, who knows.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Life is unfair, so Anne keeps getting roped into random trips and excursions that include Wentworth. This time itâs a seaside jaunt to the town of Lyme, which is apparently super awesome <strong>(AN: I just still a place that shares its name with a disease would be somewhere willingly want to go)</strong>. We meet Wentworthâs seafaring bros, Harville and Benwick, who both currently reside in Lyme. Benwick was engaged to Harvilleâs sister Fanny, but she died while he was at sea and plunged him into a never-ending spiral of despair. A great deal of Anneâs time is spent chatting with Benwick about brooding poetry and other emo things. In a classic Anne move, she tries to help him see the brighter side of things, but then wonders if she shouldnât practice what she preaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Warning:</strong> This chapter was 10 different kinds of ridiculous.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne gets some admiring glances from a mystery man staying at the same innâ¦ who is later revealed to be none other than the estranged Elliott cousin, William Walter! You know, the guy whoâs inheriting Sir Walterâs title and estate. Also the one who was supposed to marry Elizabeth, but didnât. (Who could blame him? Sheâs awful.) Wentworth notices the admiring glances and PRETENDS like he isnât bothered by them. But I could totally tell. Nice try, dude.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Everyone goes gallivanting around town for one last hurrah before they need to head back to Uppercross. Anne is genuinely sad to be leaving &#8212; for once, she kinda had a good time. Chatting about emo poetry with Benwick is waaaay better than talking about A) who Wentworth is probably going to marry B) why Wentworth is so freaking awesome or C) Maryâs various imaginary ailments, so I get where sheâs coming from here. Harville thanks Anne for hanging out with Benwick; I bet it gave him a break from all the emo for a little while.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Louisa decides it would be great fun to go around leaping from dangerous heights. Wentworth tries to <em>persuade</em> her (see what I did there? SEE WHAT JANE AUSTEN DID THERE??) not to do it, but she wonât listen and ends up CRACKING HER HEAD OPEN.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Okay she didnât crack it open but she certainly cracked it at the very least. Everyone flips out because Louisa appears to be dead. I am flipping out cause WHAT!!!! As per usual only Anne manages to get a grip. Wentworth is having an aneurism of guilt and shame, but Anne is lucid enough (and awesome enough) to be like, âOh, what was that?? But I thought you didnât like women who were âwishy-washyâ and could be convinced to change their minds????? Not such a happy hazelnut anymore, are you??!!â But she doesnât say it out loud, of course, because Anne is a classy lady. I am not a classy lady, and therefore I was totally thinking the same thing AND saying it out loud.Â <strong>(AN: this entire paragraph is A+)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Musgroves split up, some staying with Louisa at the Harvillesâ house in Lyme while the others, including Anne and Wentworth, get the jolly task of telling the Musgrove parents that one of their daughters dashed her head open at the beach. Thus ends Part I of the book. /CLIFFHANGER</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s it for this week! Stay tuned for <strong>Part III of my <em>Persuasion</em> recap</strong>, coming next Saturday! And thanks everyone for your wonderful comments on last week&#8217;s post &#8212; you may be interested to know that I&#8217;ve decided to recap other Austen works in the future, since this feature got such a good reception. Also because Alix said so. Hahahaha <b>(AN: Yaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!)</b></h3>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Special Bulletin From Your Finnikin Ambassador</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As most of you are well aware, I have made it my mission in life to <del>harass</del> convince everyone in the universe to read an incredible high fantasy series called <em>The Lumatere Chronicles </em>(<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>, <a title="Froi of the Exiles" href="http://novelideareviews.com/froi-of-the-exiles/"><em>Froi of the Exiles</em></a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15754483-quintana-of-charyn" target="_blank"><em>Quintana of Charyn</em></a>), by Melina Marchetta. I can&#8217;t even begin to express to you how much I love these books &#8212; they leave me an inarticulate, sobbing, comatose mess. After finally reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> earlier this year (WHERE HAD IT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!) I subsequently spread the Finnikin fever to several friends, happy customers all, and now we gush about the series frequently. One of those friends is the lovely <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Charlene</a> over at <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>, and we&#8217;ve teamed up to put together an entire event dedicated to our shared obsession.

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-1f78-af09-553a-01aaef6c2353" style="text-align: justify;">Â I have no qualms about admitting that I donât read classics very often. Everyone around here should know by now that Iâm on this blog mainly to act as a notorious ringleader for all kinds of shenanigans. Classics arenât really shenanigan material, so they are more the domain of my much more poised and dignified co-blogger, Alix. HOWEVERâ¦ I know Iâm not the only one out there who shies away from classics. We all have our reasons; they can be pretty intimidating, certainly, and the writing style takes adjustment. (As well as perseverance, and other virtues I might be lacking. Err&#8230;)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But fear not, my friends! I, armed with almost ten pages of notes and a lot of iced coffee, have compiled the following Essential Guide to Jane Austenâs Persuasion for those of us who are Austen-Challenged. Um, and for those of us who like shenanigans. Iâll tell you everything you need to know in four perfectly manageable installments that wonât be taxing on your brain cells.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This is intended for people who A) have read the book already or B) donât have issues with spoilers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ALSO IMPORTANT</strong>: This post is roughly 90% crack. And contains commentary by Alix</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE BASICS</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Four years ago, Anne Elliott had a whirlwind romance with adorable sailor Frederick Wentworth. They were engaged, but Anne broke things off on the (terrible) advice of her (only) friend, Lady Russell. But now Wentworth is back, twice as awesome and successful as he was when he left. Anne never stopped loving him, Wentworth is still pissed, and things are about to get SUPER awkward.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-3619"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>People You Should Know:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anne Elliott</strong>, long-suffering heroine; surrounded by pretentious morons</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Captain Frederick Wentworth</strong>, hero and jilted fiancee; not bitter about this AT ALL</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sir Walter Elliott</strong>, Anneâs father; self-appointed King of the DouchebagsÂ <strong>(A: LOL)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lady Elliott</strong>, Anneâs deceased mother; was super awesome, but unfortunately died</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Elizabeth Elliott</strong>, Anneâs older sister; self-appointed Queen of the DouchebagsÂ <strong>(A: double LOL)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mary Elliott Musgrove</strong>, Anneâs younger sister; crybaby hypochondriac</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lady Russell</strong>, Anneâs friend; responsible for giving the worldâs worst advice ever</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>William Walter Elliott</strong>, Anneâs cousin; shady individual who is also Sir Walterâs heir</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charles Musgrove</strong>, Anneâs brother-in-law; should be rewarded with medals for enduring marriage to a crybaby hypochondriac</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Admiral and Mrs. Croft</strong>, tenants of Kellynch Hall; should be rewarded with medals for all the times they donât punch their landlord (Sir Walter) in the face</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Louisa Musgrove</strong>, sister of Charles; pleasant, but impulsive</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Henrietta Musgrove</strong>, another sister of Charles; less impulsive, but still pleasant</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove</strong>, parents of Charles, Henrietta and Louisa; parents who actually love their children, GASP</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charles Hayter</strong>, cousin of the Musgroves; the 50th person in this book to be named CharlesÂ <strong>(A: It&#8217;s Austen&#8217;s way of keeping readers on their toes!)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. Bennick</strong>, one of Wentworthâs sailor friends; heartbroken, likes brooding poetry</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Captain Harville</strong>, another of Wentworthâs sailor friends; worries that Bennick reads too much brooding poetry</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fanny Harville</strong>, Bennickâs deceased fiancee; tragically died while he was at sea and is the reason why he reads brooding poetry</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mrs. Clay</strong>, friend of Elizabethâs; widow suspected of being a scheming, gold-digging minx</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Places You Should Care About:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kellynch Hall</strong> &#8211; The Elliott estate. In a shambles because Sir Walter is terrible at managing his finances.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uppercross</strong> &#8211; Residence of the Musgroves, Anneâs family through her sisterâs marriage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camden Place</strong> &#8211; The Elliott townhouse in the seaside town of Bath, where they are forced to move when they rent out Kellynch Hall.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lyme</strong> &#8211; Another charming seaside town; home of the Harvilles and Mr. BennickÂ <strong>(A: I cannot help but always call lyme disease&#8230; SEE I CAN BE SILLY TOO!)</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PART I</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter One</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We meet the Elliotts of Kellynch Hall, most of whom are snobby and unpleasant, with the notable exception of Anne. Naturally, since sheâs nothing like the rest of her family, they donât think much of her at all. Sir Walter, the family patriarch, is exceedingly vain and doesnât think highly of people he deems less attractive than himself. Also obsessed with social rank &amp; the British Peerage. He and eldest daughter Elizabeth are like two peas in a pod. They are incurable spendthrifts who have drained the estateâs finances, leaving the Elliotts with little choice but to rent out Kellynch Hall. The third Elliott sister, Mary, got married a while ago and lives not so far away at Uppercross with her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne spends most of her time having to deal with her hateful family, but perseveres in being patient and kind anyway. Even so, she still ranks dead last on her fatherâs list of favorite people, because he is a jerk. The only person who seems to appreciate her is Lady Russell, who was a friend of her motherâs.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We also learn of a cousin named William Walter Elliott (henceforth to be referred to as Cousin Elliott to minimize confusion) who will be inheriting Kellynch Hall and the title when Sir Walter dies. Apparently he is a despicable human being who talked smack about the Elliotts and then married someone else instead of Anneâs sister, Elizabeth. #Scandal</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is decided that the Elliotts must rent Kellynch Hall in order to avoid losing it forever, since they donât have the money for upkeep anymore. Sir W and Elizabeth are convinced by their solicitor and Lady R to move to the seaside town of Bath. Anne isnât thrilled about this, but no one cares what she thinks. Tagging along to Bath is Mrs. Clay, their solicitorâs widowed daughter, who is good friends with Elizabeth but not someone Lady R thinks very highly of.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Potential tenants are found for Kellynch Hall: Admiral Croft and his wife. The solicitor advises Sir W that a naval officer would be a fantastic choice to rent the estate due to their many virtues, plus it would be a good cover-up for the real reasons why the Elliotts are having to move away (i.e. Sir W sucks at managing money). Sir W expresses his wariness of seafaring men, who are often A) enterprising individuals who actually work for a living in order to succeed in life and B) not very attractive according to his high standards. <strong>(A: he is such a superficial douche king)</strong>Â He also doesnât want the future tenants to have access to the entire estate because he is, as you might have guessed by now, kind of an ass.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is revealed that Admiral Croftâs wife is also the sister of none other than Anneâs former love, Frederick Wentworth. Cue angst and initial waves of awkwardness as Anne realizes that this means their paths are very likely to cross again in the near future. Ever since taking Lady Râs (awful) advice to break off the engagement, Anne has never been the same.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The Crofts are approved to rent Kellynch Hall and the Elliotts prepare for their move to Bath. Once again, ainât nobody got time for Anneâs feelings. Younger sister and total drama queen Mary whines at Anne to come to Uppercross and take care of her during yet another of her (imaginary) bouts of illness. Meanwhile, Elizabeth makes it plain that she could care less what Anne does or where she goes.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But because Anne is a good person, she takes precious time out of her busy and productive life to attempt to warn her mean sister that Mrs. Clay might not be in this for her friendship. In fact, Anne suspects Mrs. Clay is only being friendly because she has plans to marry Sir Walter and become the new Lady Elliott <strong>(A: dun-dun-dunnnn!)</strong>. Elizabeth shoots this idea down on the basis that Mrs. Clay is ugly, has freckles for crying out loud, plus have you seen her unfortunately weird tooth?? <strong>(A: *dies laughing*)Â </strong>Anne shrugs and moves on with a clear conscience. I mean, at least she tried.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne arrives at Uppercross, home of her sister Mary and brother-in-law Charles, as well as the rest of the Musgroves and Anneâs obnoxious little nephews. We discover that Mary is a total hypochondriac and also has questionable parenting skills (or lack thereof.) Almost immediately, Anne becomes the person everyone dumps their problems on. Sheâs just such a good listener. We meet the rest of the Musgroves, who are a much more pleasant bunch than the Elliotts are. Meanwhile, Admiral and Mrs. Croft move in over at Kellynch Hall and come to Uppercross for a visit. It is announced that the day of Anneâs doom is swiftly approaching: Mrs. Croftâs brother, Captain Wentworth, is indeed returning to England after spending a few years having adventures on the high seas. Coincidentally, he was Captain of the ship where the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son, Richard, was assigned before he died. Itâs a small world after all.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne is saved at the last minute when one of her obnoxious nephews conveniently breaks his collarbone, thus derailing plans for a social engagement where Captain Wentworth will be present. Mary and Charles saddle her with their injured offspring and frolic over to the Musgrovesâ main estate to meet Wentworth anyway. Anne is relieved that she doesnât have to face him just yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The next day, Anne is forced to endure widespread squee-ing and giddiness over Captain Wentworthâs apparent hotness. Both of Charlesâ young, single, and perfectly pleasant sisters now have massive crushes on him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne manages to avoid Wentworth several more times, but they meet again at last when he comes for an unexpected visit to Uppercross. This encounter is mercifully brief, and she is extremely glad when itâs over. But later, Mary tells Anne about a conversation she had with Wentworth in which he declared that Anne is, âchanged beyond recognition.â Anne is sucker punched in the face AND SO AM I. <strong>(A: he is unfortunately a douche for saying that)Â </strong><em>Ouch</em>, Wentworth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">âShe had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and timidity.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation: Wentworth is not bitter at all, guys! Whew, I was so worried!! Maybe this isn&#8217;t going to be so awkward after all!Â <strong>(A: bwahahahahaha)</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>TO BE CONTINUED</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Part II goes up next weekend! Like it, love it, want to slap me for what I&#8217;ve done to Jane Austen?? Do tell!</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3448" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 196px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3448" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-232x300.jpg" width="186" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I paused to take a photo in between hugging the book and sobbing. You should thank me.</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">OKAY, EVERYONE CALM DOWN NOW. SERIOUSLY. Oh, it&#8217;s just me still walking around squeaking incoherently and having to take deep yoga breaths every few minutes? Ah. Okay. Well, fine then. I guess I&#8217;ll pull myself together and write this post now. Errr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahem. SO! On Tuesday afternoon I embarked on a 3 hour and 48 minute drive from Las Vegas, NV to La Verne, CA so I could be there for the <em>Crown of Midnight</em> launch party at Mrs. Nelson&#8217;s Books. I can&#8217;t even articulate how ridiculously excited I was for this to happen. I mean, I&#8217;ve been writhing in agony and pretty much dying to get my hands on the book for months now. (Some of you may still remember the tragic moment when I was rejected for the ARC on Netgalley and subsequently spiraled into despair for days afterward &#8212; especially since the rejection was horrifically timed right before my birthday&#8230; *starts crying again just remembering this*)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But wait! There were two other huge, hysteria-inducing reasons for my excitement: 1) of course, Sarah J. Maas was going to be there and I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO SPEAK WITH HERÂ  and 2) one of my most fabulous bookish friends, Charlene from <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>, was going to be there too! Um, yeah, indulge in a mini freak-out with me real fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3447"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3452" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 190px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo5.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3452" alt="photo5" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo5-300x300.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our giant pile of books waiting to be signed (with Finnikin thrown in for good measure haha)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say, from the moment I arrived at the bookstore I was in a state of pure, undeniable, all caps EEEEEEKKKK. I&#8217;m not kidding. My brain was just one long string of EEEEKKKKKK for pretty much the entire night. It went a lot like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found Charlene in the bookstore and we hugged and flailed around &#8212; EEEEKKKK</li>
<li>There was chocolate cake (Charlene got to it ASAP, guys. Don&#8217;t mess with this girl and the cake.)Â  &#8212; EEEEEKKKK</li>
<li>I picked up a gorgeous hardcover copy of <em>Crown of Midnight</em> &#8212; EEEEEEKKK</li>
<li>I realized that fellow blogger &amp; recent Twitter acquaintance <a href="http://t.co/SirTU3y4Jj" target="_blank">Stacie</a> was also there &#8212; EEEEEEKKKK</li>
<li>Sarah J. Maas arrived and was waving to everyone &#8212; EEEEEKKKKKK</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3453" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 220px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo6.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3453 " alt="photo6" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo6-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene &amp; I :D</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so on, et al etc, for like 3 hours. The level of Awesomeness only escalated while Sarah was talking about how she got published and the story behind the <em>Throne of Glass</em> series. Right off the bat she mentioned both Robin McKinley AND Garth Nix as inspirations while she was dreaming of becoming a published writer from the time she was in high school &#8212; that&#8217;s right, two of my absolute favorite authors of all time. (Just picture me in my seat flipping out and essentially wanting to wave a sign saying SARAH WE ARE KINDRED SPIRITS.) She went on to answer some questions about her upcoming New Adult series, scheduled for 2015 publication, which isÂ  going to be a fantasy based on <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em> and <em>Tam Lin</em>. (I already knew about the series coming out, but picture me freaking out over it anyway at this point.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, someone raised their hand and asked Sarah what kind of books she reads when she isn&#8217;t busy writing. This, my friends, is when the levels of Awesomeness completely transcended all previous possible limits, because Sarah answered that she&#8217;s a huge Melina Marchetta fan. She told us about meeting Melina at Comic-Con last year and just being utterly overwhelmed by the experience, all while Charlene and I were high-fiving and essentially dying of joy in the third row. Sarah confessed that she actually hadn&#8217;t even started the third book yet because she wasn&#8217;t sure she could handle the feels, and I couldn&#8217;t resist chiming in that we were in the same boat. This kind of derailed the rest of the conversation as we veered into Finnikin fangirling territory. It went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Us: &#8220;OMG WE HAVEN&#8217;T READ QUINTANA OF CHARYN YET EITHER. We decided to read it together for the moral support!!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah: &#8220;OMG YOU GUYS ARE MY SPIRIT ANIMALS&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Us: &#8220;OMG HELP THAT JUST MADE MY ENTIRE LIFE EEEEKKKK&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rest of the room: &#8230;..?????</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys. I just. I can&#8217;t even. Askahfdkjahsdfkjhakshdfkjsdhf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were the last to get our books signed, which was probably a good thing since this process took some time to get through. Sarah was amazing throughout the entire book launch, by the way. I didn&#8217;t think I could love this author any more than I already do, but I LOVE HER SO MUCH. It was my first ever book signing and I&#8217;m so glad this is the author I got to see. She was super funny, fangirled over Finnikin with us, and patiently signed everything we&#8217;d brought. She also wrote in our copies of <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> (all the while saying SORRY MELINA!!! and squeaking while saying she couldn&#8217;t believe she was &#8220;defacing&#8221; a Melina Marchetta book hahaha) and took a photo with us. BEST DAY EVER AAAHHHH.</p>
<div id="attachment_3455" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 532px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signedbooks.png"><img class=" wp-image-3455" alt="signedbooks" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signedbooks.png" width="522" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">She had to sign her name really small on my copy of Throne of Glass because we were both saying EEEEE and she wrote it all over the page before signing!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was such an incredible experience. Seriously. I feel like I could babble on and on about it forever. Sarah was already a favorite author of mine and it was almost overwhelming getting to meet her and finding out how warm, approachable, and AMAZING she is in person. Plus I got to meet Charlene!!!! AAAHHH!!! The funny thing is that even though we&#8217;d never actually met before, I already felt like we&#8217;d known each other forever because of Twitter and email and our blogs. So it was a lot like seeing an old friend. I laughed so much my face hurt.</p>
<div id="attachment_3457" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 482px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo7.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3457" alt="photo7" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo7-1024x793.jpg" width="472" height="365" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">LOL my glasses were falling off my face and you can&#8217;t see my eyes!! I look like this: ^__^ OH WELL IT DOESN&#8217;T MATTER BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">THANK YOU SO MUCH SARAH!!!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head over to Bookish Whimsy today to check out <a href="http://t.co/GdlAXg4WG7" target="_blank">Charlene&#8217;s recap of the event</a>, which will probably be much more dignified than mine, haha. You should be immensely jealous that I got to talk about cake and <em>The Little Mermaid</em> with her!!! I just finished <em>Crown of Midnight</em> yesterday (I went on a total binge and accomplished nothing else) so watch for my review coming soon. In the meantime, I wrote a guest post for the <em>Throne of Glass</em> tribute over at Ink Shelves, which will be up on their blog this coming Sunday! You can go hear me wax poetic about Celaena Sardothien, who is MY spirit animal. (Well, one of them. The other is Isaboe of Lumatere, obviously.)</p>
