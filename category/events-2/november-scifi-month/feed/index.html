<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Itâs a Bird! Itâs a Plane! Itâs Sci-fi Month!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-its-sci-fi-month/" target="_blank">It&#8217;s a Bird! It&#8217;s a Plane! It&#8217;s Sci-Fi Month!</a> |Â Scifi: It&#8217;s Not Just A Guy Thing</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now you might think this is gonna be another post bashing guys who bash girls who like sci-fi, or about being judge/teased by guys because you&#8217;re a girl in sci-fi. And sure, I could write a post about that but this isn&#8217;t it. Â One of the things I&#8217;ve enjoyed the most in planning out my Sci-Fi Month posts has been reflecting on how I became a Sci-Fi fan. My path started off in television when I was a young teen, swerved into movies Â as an older teen and finally passed through books as an adult. When I was 11 started watching The X-Files (in French no less!), IÂ <strong>loved</strong> it, I wasÂ <strong>obsessed</strong> with it! But aside from the 2 friends I would watch it with, I didn&#8217;t really talk about how much I loved it. Why? Well because of <em>my</em> mind, only guys liked sci-fi. The biggest obstacle I ever encountered in the sci-fi genre as a fan, has been, well me!</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Star Trek was the TV my friend&#8217;s dad was obsessed with and it was my friends&#8217; older brothers who were the ones who would &#8220;make&#8221; us watch Star Wars. If I showed too much interest. I was teased both by guys and girls so absorbed that stereotype and ran with it because it was simpler then to challenge it. I was comfortable in my enjoyment of television sci-fi and the couple of friends who shared Â it (but it was still very hush hush). Â But the wonderful thing about the Internet was that it allowed me to get over it (for TV at least). I met all these amazing women who loved and enjoyed sci-fi as much as me. I never experience guys judging me for it or saying I wasn&#8217;t good enough online (which surprised me). We were all fans, all equals and it was great!Â I discovered that there were tons of girls, who just like me, loved shows like The Â X-Files, Sliders, Stargate (just to name a few). I shifted from a completely closeted fan to an out only online fan. I was content. I still refused to watch the &#8220;classic&#8221; sci-fi because I still saw it as a guy thing. In my circle, it was fine to like &#8220;new&#8221; sci-fi but the &#8220;old&#8221; stuff was still labeled a boys club. And books? Well girls certainly didn&#8217;t read sci-fi books! Even my girl friends who watch it, said reading sci-fi was &#8220;too nerdy&#8221; and it was for guys. Again, I just went with it. I didn&#8217;t want to be teased.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I stayed like that until about 5 years ago. One of my guy friends was a huge sci-fi, the kind of guy sci-fi fan I had judged and assumed wouldn&#8217;t want to share that with me. We were talking once and I mentioned all the sci-fi stuff I liked and he asked me what books from the genre I read. When I said none, Â he was shocked and immediately gave me list of titles. Which I devoured and adored.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since then I have realized my own prejudices and wrong assumptions deprived me of enjoying and sharing my love of sci-fi with guys. I assumed they wouldn&#8217;t want me in their club but all the guys I know who like sci-fi, who I have talked to about it have never done anything but share in my enjoyment of discussing the genre! I was wrong: so to all you awesome, sci-fi loving guys of the world, I am sorry I thought you didn&#8217;t want me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What has been your experience with sci-fi? Do you still think it&#8217;s a &#8220;guy thing&#8221;? Have you ever judge or were judge for liking sci-fi? Let&#8217;s talk!</h2>

<h3>I am so excited to be a participating in Sci-Fi Month organized by the lovely <a href="http://www.rinnreads.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rinn of Rinn Reads</a>! Every week for the month I&#8217;ll be posting sci-fi related posts every week for the month of November ranging from my favourite books, movies &amp; tv shows to reviews! There&#8217;s also a surprise for <em>you</em> at the end (hint: it rhymes with biveaway ;)</h3>
<p><strong>1. Tell us a little bit about yourself?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m Alix, the &#8220;mysterious&#8221; half of A Novel Idea. ;) I&#8217;m 29 and Canadian. I&#8217;ve been blogging with Paola for less then year and I absolutely love it. Paola is my book sister from a different mother.</p>
<p>I work as a project manager, which keeps my insanely busy (but I love it!). I&#8217;ve had a passion for books since I was a kid as well a tv/movies. I am a total pop culture junky.</p>
<p><strong> 2. How long have you been a fan of sci-fi?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of sci-fi since my early teens (so over 15 years)! I started enjoying television sci-fi shows (if it aired in the 90s and was sci-fi, I probably watched it!). FromÂ <em>The X-Files</em> toÂ <em>Sliders</em> to <i>Doctor Who</i> toÂ <em>Stargate</em> and so many more, those shows have all played a huge part in my life.</p>
<p>I started reading sci-fi only about 5 years ago. I might be late to party but have completely fallen in love with the written sci-fi genre and have consumed mass amount of it since!</p>
<p><strong>3. Why do you like sci-fi and what is your favourite thing about it?</strong></p>
<p>I love how it allows your imagination to run wild. If you can imagine it, you can find it in sci-fi. It also allows us explore other worlds and futures and how our society and different societies might be. I also love how sci-fi has been able to be so relevant to your life and times even though it&#8217;s sci-fi. I also love just how broad of a genre it is! There are so many different kind of sci-fi and you can always find something.</p>
<p><strong>4. Favourite books/games/films/TV shows etc in the genre?</strong></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have to come back and check out my not one, but two! posts dedicated to my favourites. :)</p>
<p><strong>5. What do you have planned for Sci-Fi Month?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be posting a variety of posts every week! I have a couple of favourite lists: for books and for tv/television, a thoughts and musing post about being a woman who enjoys sci-fi as well as a review ofÂ <em>Ready Player One</em> and the movie version ofÂ <em>Ender&#8217;s Game</em>, one of my all-time favourite books and recently released film! I&#8217;m gonna wrap up the month with a specialÂ <del>not so secret</del> surprise!</p>
<h3>Whether you&#8217;re a sci-fi fan or novice, I hope you join me on this out of this world ride!</h3>
