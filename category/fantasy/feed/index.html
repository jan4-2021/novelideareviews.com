				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Holly Black</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Paranormal/Urban Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013; Little, Brown BFYR</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtownâs gates, you can never leave.</p>
<p>One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been such a long time since I read a vampire book I enjoyed this much &#8212; I was well and truly impressed with the gritty and yet oddly glamorous world of Holly Black&#8217;s vampires and the humans who co-exist with them. I loved that the story was full of both beauty and blood. I loved the entire pop culture phenomenon she created around vampirism. I loved her heroine. I JUST LOVED IT OKAY.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about the world we see in this novel is that it&#8217;s so very believable, especially when you consider modern culture and the things society values and finds entertaining right now, as we speak. Holly Black&#8217;s vampires are relegated to Coldtowns, where they are walled away from the rest of the population but still the center of a universe that is inexorably drawn to their allure. Magnetic, fascinating, and infinitely dangerous, they are both feared and yet hopelessly admired. It was crazy seeing vampirism from this angle. There are vampire tourist traps, vampire blogs, vampire hunter shows littered with crossbows and imagery that ranges from the grotesquely fascinating to just plain grotesque.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3305"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Immortal, the vampires celebrate a night that never ends, which in turn is accessible to anyone with cable. This atmosphere was conveyed with masterful execution that gave the reader insight into a lot of different perspectives, from the blogger obsessed with being immortal to the rest of the population that lives outside all of that glory and gore, still striving to live the most normal lives possible in the wake of a vampirism epidemic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This vividly rendered world would be pointless without the right kind of heroine, and I&#8217;m happy to say that Tana is absolutely right for her role. I loved that she was so determined to hang on to who she was, even when it would have been easier to give in and let go of every shred of humanity she possessed. She&#8217;s a fighter in so many ways. I liked her attitude, her practical acceptance that in order to get through this ordeal she would have to do things that would not only hurt her, but possibly hurt others as well. I guess I just like that kind of personality in my heroines. When you&#8217;re faced with a terrible situation, do you panic and fall apart, or do you get a grip and keep moving on? Tana chooses the latter. A lot of shit goes down, but she sticks to her ideals and what&#8217;s important to her. I can&#8217;t help but respect that in a character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mean, Tana manages to stay true to herself even with GAVRIEL to deal with. Guys, we can&#8217;t talk about him, okay? Because I will start screaming and flailing and just turn into a pile of slush. Here is a complex character in every sense of the word. We never know what&#8217;s going on with him. We&#8217;re never entirely sure where his allegiance lies. He proves to be both unpredictable and slightly deranged, but it&#8217;s somehow perfect. The attraction between these two is ridiculous and heart-stopping and again, somehow perfect. I have to say that Gavriel is one of my favorite leading men (and vampires) ever.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely loved it. And it&#8217;s not part of a series, but this is one of those rare occasions when I kind of found myself wishing it was a series, because I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of the world and the characters (and Gavriel, ahem) in only one book. That being said, I also love that it was a standalone in a genre dominated by series. You get closure, even if you don&#8217;t get to have more delicious vampire men. /sigh/ Oh, fine. Anyway, highly recommended &#8212; definitely the best vampire book I&#8217;ve read since Robin McKinley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8088.Sunshine?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sunshine</em></a>, which is saying something when you consider that <em>Sunshine</em> happens to be <a title="#26: SUNSHINE" href="http://novelideareviews.com/26-sunshine/" target="_blank">one of my favorite books of all time</a> AND combines the immortal undead with tons of cinnamon rolls. I mean, could you get a higher recommendation from me based on this??? No. <strong>So go get this book!!</strong> (And <em>Sunshine</em> too, okay??)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-journey-home-a-celebration-of-the-lumatere-chronicles/"><img alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Unlike my experience actually reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> for the first time, the story behind how I discovered the book isn&#8217;t at all exciting. I devour fantasy books on a regular basis and I&#8217;m always looking for my next escape, which is what led me to Lumatere. I remember skimming through a few reviews on Goodreads and finding myself compelled by the sheer amount of people who were rendered incoherent and/or speechless by this book. This got me thinking that I should probably pick it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="finnpost01" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/finnpost01-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></strong>Some 400 pages later, I realized this had been one of the best literary moments of my life. EVER. But I&#8217;d packed my bags and applied for permanent citizenship long before that. Maybe it was the first time Evanjalin rolled her eyes at Finnikin. (And all the subsequent times hahaha) Maybe it was every single time these characters kept going, never giving up on the home they&#8217;d been forced to leave behind. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on when it happened exactly, but somewhere on that journey I decided I belonged there too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3909"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think many of us who read fantasy are drawn to the genre because A) it gives us a chance to get away to an entirely different world and/or B) it gives us a chance to live in a world where the epic and the legendary are still possible. Lumatere exemplifies both, for me. This is a place where there is power in every promise, where honor and loyalty still matter, where love is unbreakable. These are people who do absolutely nothing by halves, whether it&#8217;s living or loving or dying. It&#8217;s where friendship is a bond that lasts forever, where I&#8217;ve witnessed every possible way to be brave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It never ceases to amaze. Melina Marchetta is capable of rendering me into a sobbing, laughing, inarticulate mess with only one sentence. This universe of hers even seems to be rendered in colors more vivid than the ones in our spectrum, to the point that reading this series somehow made me feel more <em>alive</em>. And I guess this feeling just makes me want to take this book and give it to everyone I meet. I just want you to see what I see. I want you to experience this crazy, crushing, heartbreaking, exhilarating, BEAUTIFUL feeling. It&#8217;s why I came to Lumatere and never left.</p>

<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sherry Thomas</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013 &#8211; Balzer + Bray</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Prince Titus has known for years that his fate is to find and protect the next great elemental mage of his generation. He&#8217;s been preparing for every eventuality, rightly anticipating that this task will be far from easy. Such a powerful mage would be ruthlessly hunted, especially because a prophecy exists that says they will be the savior of the Realm &#8212; the one to finally end the tyrannical rule of the Bane, who currently controls even Prince Titus with an iron fist. But a complication of epic proportions arises when Titus finally crosses paths with this prophesied hero&#8230; and things turn out to be nothing like he expected.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am so stupidly in love with this book that I can&#8217;t stop the crazy urge to giggle and flail around as I write my review. I&#8217;m sure you all know that while I read other genres too, my heart belongs with Fantasy and I feel most at home when adventuring through the countryside in search of dragons to vanquish. (Would I be any good at actually vanquishing dragons in real life? No. That would be a disaster. Also it is beside the point~) <em>The Burning Sky</em> contains clever characters, fascinating magic, harrowing political schemes, adorable boys in school uniforms, and a feels-inducing romance. In short, I WANTED FOR NOTHING.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3770"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First we need to talk about this book&#8217;s dynamic duo. Iolanthe Seabourne is a rare elemental mage, capable of controlling three of the four elements in a time when most others like her are only barely able to command one. While her guardian sinks ever deeper into a slump that has lasted for decades, she is forced to be the responsible one in the household. This is difficult enough without the added problem of suddenly being chased by other mages who want to capture and exploit her powers. Also chasing Iolanthe is Prince Titus, whose mother predicted he would meet the next great elemental mage and that his destiny was to protect her at all cost. Guys, THESE TWO. They are such a power couple in every sense of the word. I loved their relationship through all of its ups and downs. The best thing about it was that Iolanthe and Titus are more than a match for one another. They&#8217;re both intelligent, cunning, and resourceful, and they balance each other so well. Titus is the sort of person to be perennially prepared for everything, and Iolanthe manages to keep him on his toes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, I&#8217;m pretty sure Titus is now one of my top ten favorite male leads of all time. I will NOT start talking about why because this review will then go on forever. Suffice it to say that I love him desperately. I think I knew it was true love even before he boarded his private train car while carrying a pet canary named Miss Buttercup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a plot that moves at a lightning pace. There was never a dull moment for me. It&#8217;s also filled with humorous moments as Prince Titus labors to hide Iolanthe at none other than Eton College, a lone girl among hordes of schoolboys. If you&#8217;re wondering why Eton and England in general make an appearance in the book, it&#8217;s because <em>The Burning Sky</em> features a universe where there are multiple worlds, some magical and some not. Ours is not a magical world here, but it does have a significant population of exiles from realms that do have magic. But you shouldn&#8217;t be worrying about that because it&#8217;s more fun to follow our hero and heroine from one misadventure to another. I really enjoyed the mix of funny banter and constant danger. Such things make me happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s plenty of action and excellent world building going on here. I also loved the atmosphere of secrets and subterfuge, and the fact that everyone had an agenda. I did see shades of Harry Potter going on, a comparison that is probably difficult to avoid when reading anything that involves magic and boarding school. But I really feel like Sherry Thomas created a world (well, worlds) that are entirely her own. As a fan of everything fantasy, I always love to encounter new concepts and twists on ideas that have been around for a while and in that sense I think this book delivered without question. The only thing that I found myself feeling a bit conflicted about was how varied and I guess practically limitless the magic system was &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much that magic couldn&#8217;t do for you, from tailoring your clothes (admittedly I would find this very useful) to transforming yourself into a bird. I think it could have had a few more limitations to make it seem more believable&#8230; but this really didn&#8217;t stop me from having the time of my life while reading.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite books of the year, without a doubt. <em>The Burning Sky</em> was an incredible ride and is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy as much as I do. Stay tuned later today for my recap of the Dark Days Tour stop here in Las Vegas, which will involve me running around shrieking and sobbing with joy at getting to meet Sherry Thomas in person!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Stacey Jay</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 256 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The domed city of Yuan is the only safe haven for miles in the harsh deserts of Isra&#8217;s dying planet. The lands outside the dome are prowled by the Monstrous &#8212; mutated beasts like Gem. They were once human, and are now shunned from the cities where those without mutations dwell in privilege and even luxury. Their safety comes at a terrible price, however; a price that Isra knows too well. The blind princess of Yuan keeps many secrets, not all of which are her own. Her path collides with Gem&#8217;s when the starving Monstrous attempt to steal the source of Yuan&#8217;s prosperity and fail. What unfolds is a friendship, and then a love, that could change the fate of their world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a huge fan of fairytales and an even bigger fan of fairytale retellings, especially creative ones. I&#8217;ve read quite a few of these over the years, but I have to say that <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> is by far the most unique version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. And you know, sometimes I just get this gut feeling about a book&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to explain, but some books I just KNOW I&#8217;m going to love. I read the synopsis and DONE, let me have it RIGHT NOW. This was one of those inexplicable moments of book serendipity for me. (I mean, just read the synopsis&#8230; OF COURSE THIS WAS MEANT FOR ME. Hello???)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3300"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to being the most unique <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> retelling I&#8217;ve ever come across, <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> also holds the record for creepiest use of that fairytale&#8217;s rose motif. Seriously. I challenge you to find creepier roses than the ones in this book. It was only one of the many creative twists the author implemented. In fact, the world building and storyline are so well developed that the original fairytale is more like the bone structure underneath, giving the plot its shape but not constricting it. I&#8217;ve found over time that this is my favorite kind of retelling, because you can still trace it back to its fairytale roots, but it can also stand alone as something entirely unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought Isra in particular was a fantastic piece of character development all around. With every revelation, every little piece of her world that turns out to be a lie, she loses her footing but rallies and goes two steps further than she did before. This girl&#8217;s a fighter. Despite being born within the Dome and not having to deal with the unforgiving environs of the desert outside, despite never wanting for food or shelter, Isra is still at quite a disadvantage in the beginning of the story. For one thing, she&#8217;s been blind since childhood, which makes the lies that imprison her all the more difficult to detect. But as the story progresses, and as she forms a bond with Gem and begins to question everything she&#8217;s been forced to accept, Isra just gets tougher and tougher. She&#8217;s determined to deal with things in her own way, with this inherent bossiness that perfectly suits her, but also a deep compassion and empathy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually it&#8217;s the Beast that holds Beauty captive, but in this story it&#8217;s the other way around. When Gem and his fellow Monstrous are caught trying to steal the roses that are the heart of Yuan&#8217;s magic, Isra orders her guards to spare Gem&#8217;s life, and he becomes her prisoner. Their relationship starts with them at odds with one another, basically hating each other&#8217;s guts, and I <em>loved</em> that things were so complicated. I also loved that Isra was not necessarily in a position of power just because she was a princess; there are a lot of political machinations at work in this story that thrilled me because I enjoy that kind of thing. She was as much of an outcast in the domed city as Gem, if for different reasons. They&#8217;re both complex characters with secrets and agendas of their own, with a lot of differences to reconcile between them. This made their romance so much more gratifying to me. It was hard-won, and therefore felt more real and worthwhile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was so impressed with the depth and creativity of this alternate version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. If you&#8217;re a lover of fairytales, high fantasy, or even science fiction (this one has a bit of a sci fi twist to it here and there, although the fantasy aspect is more prevalent), then you should definitely give <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> a try. This is <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> like you&#8217;ve never seen before. I absolutely loved it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for more retellings of favorite fairytales? Here are some of my favorite twists on <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/" target="_blank"><em>Cinderella</em></a>, <a title="#3: SPINDLEâS END" href="http://novelideareviews.com/spindles-end/" target="_blank"><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></a>, and <a title="#2: EAST" href="http://novelideareviews.com/east/" target="_blank"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></a>. Ah, and some shameless plugging: if you remember the <a title="The Round-Robin Project" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-round-robin-project/">Round Robin writing project</a> I announced on the blog last month, then you may be interested to know that the girls and I decided to write an epic fairytale retelling ourselves! So stay tuned for more on that in the coming months :)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Beth Durst</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Bloomsbury Walker</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via Netgalley; 370 pages</p>
<p><strong>ALSO BY THIS AUTHOR</strong>: <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank"><em>Vessel</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eve remembers nothing about her past. Her only clues are strange, often frightening scenes from her nightmares &#8212; fragmented memories of a storyteller weaving twisted tales and a magician whose act is more dangerous than it seems. But she knows that her origins are tied to a series of brutal murders and missing teenagers, and that the killer would do anything to find her. Even with a new face and the protection of a special branch of the Witness Protection Program, Eve is in danger every day, especially because of her own volatile magic&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year I fell head over heels in love with Sarah Beth Durst&#8217;s incredible high fantasy novel <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank"><em>Vessel</em></a>, so you can imagine my excitement when I saw <em>Conjured</em> up for request on Netgalley. I was completely enthralled by the premise, which promised this awesome magical murder mystery with creepy circus moments. You may think that&#8217;s a bizarre combination to send a girl&#8217;s heart racing, but I like most anything that includes magic and danger in the same sentence so this was a no-brainer for me. Plus I like to be creeped out once in a while, and <em>Conjured</em> certainly does have its eerie moments. While I don&#8217;t have the same breathless love for this book that I do for <em>Vessel</em>, I still liked it and it was a solid read for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3468"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Eve, but I liked the <em>mystery</em> of Eve even more. I appreciated that her amnesia didn&#8217;t make her into the kind of character that just stumbles along wherever the plot takes her. Oftentimes it seems that when characters lose their memory, the author uses it as a handy vehicle to dump all kinds of world building and backstory into the plot. But in this instance, the author turns Eve&#8217;s blank past into a catalyst for a hundred other questions you want to find the answers to. You know from the beginning that she&#8217;s important, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be so adamant about protecting her from the killer. But what is Eve&#8217;s role in the case? Is she a victim, or an accomplice, or both? I was happy to see Eve taking matters into her own hands, even when her protectors would have preferred for her to be herded around like a sheep. And while she does want to know what happened to her in the past, and who she used to be, Eve doesn&#8217;t let her amnesia define her. She slowly reinvents herself, or I guess I should say rediscovers herself, and learns new things along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magic was interesting, as was the surprise element of multiple worlds outside our own. But I was a bit put off by Eve&#8217;s relationship with Zach, and I didn&#8217;t warm up to him all that much even though I know I was supposed to find him adorable and quirky. Normally I&#8217;m all about the adorable and quirky, but he just didn&#8217;t click with me and I can&#8217;t explain why. I wasn&#8217;t a fan of the means by which Eve was able to share her magic with Zach &#8212; won&#8217;t go into it cause it may be considered a spoiler &#8212; but I one thing I did like about these two was that they worked very well together. They were a good team, even if I didn&#8217;t buy into their romance at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps my favorite parts of the book were Eve&#8217;s nightmares. That probably sounds crazy too, but like I said above, I like a little creepiness in my life! Err, as long as it&#8217;s not actually IN my life. I don&#8217;t mind reading about it. The dream sequences were exceptionally eerie and served to make the mystery even more compelling as a whole. Every time Eve had another nightmare, I was always left desperately wanting to know what it all meant and how the puzzle pieces fit together. Clues are scattered throughout her dreams, fragments of old memories that she lost before the story even began. I enjoyed trying to figure it all out. I admit that I was kept guessing through almost all of the story, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely satisfied with the ending or the way the main conflict was resolved; I felt a little bit disappointed, like all that build-up was for a lackluster conclusion. I was especially discomfited by Zach&#8217;s part of the ending, which only made my existing unease with his character even worse.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A solid read with a mystery wrapped up in strange magic and a bit of journeying between worlds. I enjoyed both the creepiness and the process of trying to put together all the clues to Eve&#8217;s forgotten past, but found some aspects of the plot disappointing and didn&#8217;t think much of the romance. I liked this book, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely crazy about it, or at least not as crazy as I am over <em>Vessel</em>. (Have I <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank">talked that one up</a> enough?? Why aren&#8217;t you reading it yet??) Overall, despite how problematic I found some of it to be, I still had a positive experience with <em>Conjured</em>.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jay Kristoff</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy, Steampunk</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013; St. Martin&#8217;s Griffin</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: ARC from Publisher, 437 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/" target="_blank"><em>Stormdancer</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fate of Shima hangs in the balance, with the Imperium on the brink of civil war and people of all walks of life rising to answer the Stormdancer&#8217;s call. Yukiko and Buruu are living legends, carrying the rebellion&#8217;s hopes on their shoulders. But Yukiko, still reeling from grief and regret, must now also find a way to control her abilities before they do lasting damage. Fueled by rage, she leads the charge against the Lotus Guild and the failing Kazumitsu dynasty at the risk of completely losing herself in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sequels this year are KILLING ME. SERIOUSLY. I mean, I&#8217;m sitting here right now staring at the screen, trying to figure out how to articulate the intense experience that was <em>Kinslayer</em> and just utterly failing. It&#8217;s hard to write a review when you&#8217;re sort of still peeling yourself off the floor and trying to salvage what&#8217;s left of your crushed heart. I thought <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/"><em>Stormdancer</em></a> was epic, heartbreaking, GLORIOUS &#8212; but its sequel somehow found a way to be all those things <em>and more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3304"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book hits the ground running, and the action doesn&#8217;t stop until the very end. It&#8217;s a breathless, heart-stopping ride. When I read the first book earlier this year, I remember feeling initially overwhelmed by the author&#8217;s attention to detail; it was a lot to take in and process within those first hundred or so pages, and the one aspect of <em>Stormdancer</em> that bothered me. But with <em>Kinslayer</em>, that attention to detail becomes an incredible asset. This is an intense sensory experience that just consumes you. Everything, from the black depths of Yukiko&#8217;s grief to Shima&#8217;s bleak, broken landscape is rendered in such a powerful way that the colors seem twice as vivid and the emotions just leave you reeling. Jay Kristoff gets all my praise for this world he&#8217;s created and the characters that will ultimately decide its fate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of characters &#8212; Jay Kristoff, THANK YOU FOR MICHI. <em>From the bottom of my heart</em>. Yukiko and Buruu become even more amazing in this book (Buruu had me tearing up already only twenty pages in, I kid you not), but Michi absolutely stole the show for me. I think I need to add her to my list of spirit animals. I can&#8217;t even talk about her right now, I&#8217;m afraid of devolving into a useless, slushy pile of feels. I think this series is pretty remarkable for the amount of badass heroines stalking its pages. And what I love is that they&#8217;re badass in so many varied ways, displaying strength in so many different forms. Not all heroines prove their worth with swords. There is also strength in silence, in endurance despite pain, and sometimes words and secrets are more potent than any weapon you can hold in your hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel like the second book in a series is a precarious place to be. It can be difficult to live up to the first book, as we see with so many unfortunate instances of Second Book Syndrome out there. I&#8217;m happy to report that Kinslayer takes the momentum of its predecessor and transcends every expectation. The plot gets even more complicated as war looms on the horizon, with the Lotus Guild desperately trying to salvage everything Yukiko destroyed even as the Kage Rebellion continue their efforts to save Shima from the poison within. I love that we get to see the rebellion from more than one side. The campaign to save Shima from itself involves more than simply spilling blood. This war is waged from multiple fronts &#8212; in the skies with Yukiko and Buruu, amid the towering trees of Shima&#8217;s last remaining forest, even in the opulent halls of the Imperial palace. Loyalties are tested and beliefs are questioned. You&#8217;re slapped in the face by one revelation after another, revelations that give some really mind-blowing answers to your questions, but also leave a trail of NEW questions in their wake.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any good sequel, I turned to the last page with this unshakeable sense that a storm is coming&#8230; and it&#8217;s going to be RIDICULOUS. It&#8217;s going to be the death of my feels. I couldn&#8217;t recommend this book, or this series, more. I&#8217;m upset that I have to wait so long for the next book, but also kind of relieved because 1) <em>Kinslayer</em> turned me into a flailing, sobbing train wreck and I need a considerable recovery period and 2) I have to brace myself for what&#8217;s ahead, and I have to start doing that now. Oh, by the way, <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte</a> and I have given the third book the tentative title ofÂ <em>Feelscrusher</em>. We feel that this is 100% appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you so much to the publisher for sending me an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review. I am seriously overcome with gratitude because it was one of my most anticipated reads of the year and the series is such a favorite of mine.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah J. Maas</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: August 2013, Bloomsbury Walker; Hardcover, 420 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="Throne of Glass" href="http://novelideareviews.com/throne-of-glass/" target="_blank"><em>Throne of Glass</em></a>, <a title="Throne of Glass Novellas" href="http://novelideareviews.com/throne-of-glass-novellas/" target="_blank"><em>Throne of Glass Novellas</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Celaena Sardothien is now the King&#8217;s Champion, sworn to be the hand that brings death to his enemies. But although Celaena may have declared fealty to the King of Adarlan &#8212; the same man who robbed her of kin and country &#8212; she is far from loyal to him. There has never been a time when she blindly followed orders, and now is no exception. This is a secret she keeps from even those closest to her, one that could lead to the loss of everything she has managed to gain since Prince Dorian and his Captain of the Guard came to take her from the salt mines of Endovier. What will Adarlan&#8217;s Assassin be willing to sacrifice, and where do her true loyalties lie?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*brain explodes* I CAN&#8217;T REVIEW THIS BOOK. I CAN&#8217;T. Okay, maybe I can&#8230; but it&#8217;s gonna take A LOT of cake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3475"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You know that horrible little thing called Second Book Syndrome? Well, none of it is happening here. This is what the second book in a series should look like, people. <em>Crown of Midnight</em> takes all the certified badassery of the first book and multiplies it tenfold. Everyone has secrets they would kill to keep and there isn&#8217;t a single moment when you&#8217;re not being beaten over the head with high intensity feels. Everything I loved about <em>Throne of Glass</em> took on new dimensions. People I thought I couldn&#8217;t love more ended up reaching for my heart and crushing it in their fists. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO WAIT FOR THE THIRD BOOK???</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahem. Okay. Anyway, what I really want to say about <em>Crown of Midnight</em> is that it completely stole the show from its predecessor. Celaena returns fiercer than ever (and with an even deeper appreciation for dessert). I love how all her experiences continue to shape her, creating a character that is constantly evolving. Love, loss, rage and revenge are such shallow words when it comes to Celaena; it&#8217;s like you can&#8217;t just describe her with plain English. Seriously, I can barely articulate my feelings right now. She&#8217;s one of my favorite characters ever. And Chaol? Absolutely PERFECT. His development here is spot on. I expected the conflict to intensify on his end, especially after everything that happened in the first book. But all that heavy emotional stuff aside, I will always pick Chaol because he has such a keen understanding of exactly when a girl could use some chocolate hazelnut cake. FORREALS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Dorian</em> though, guys. I wasn&#8217;t really a Dorian fan when I read <em>Throne of Glass</em>, but I have to say that his character&#8217;s growth in book two was incredible. He gained so much depth. And I really, really, REALLY wanted to give him a hug. I never thought I&#8217;d end up with such an appreciation for Dorian, but now I do. Such is the power of <em>Crown of Midnight</em>.</p>
<p>Speaking of Dorian, I&#8217;m sure everyone knows that I will ship Celaena/Chaol up until the day I die, so I won&#8217;t inundate you with all my lovestruck babble here. I don&#8217;t know how to talk about these two without massive spoilers sneaking in, so I just won&#8217;t. Well, okay, maybe I&#8217;ll say ONE thing, which I will hide under the spoiler cut below.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hang on, have to stop and take deep yoga breaths to calm my shattered nerves. /melodrama/</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I realize that this review wasn&#8217;t nearly as deep and insightful as you probably wanted to see from me, but I am simply unable to sound intelligent after reading something that involves Feels Facepunches of this magnitude. If you want a well-written, completely coherent review of <em>Crown of Midnight</em>, <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/2013/08/review-crown-of-midnight.html" target="_blank">go visit Charlene at Bookish Whimsy</a>. She&#8217;s way more levelheaded about this than I am. Um, but if you&#8217;re in need of someone to sob hysterically with, I&#8217;m your girl! I&#8217;m heartbroken, truthfully, but in a good way. This is one series that will be breaking my heart and putting it back together again all the way to the end.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: April Genevieve Tucholke</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy/Paranormal</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Penguin Young Readers Group</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC via Netgalley</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing much exciting rolls through Violet Whiteâs sleepy, seaside townâ¦until River West comes along. River rents the guesthouse behind Violetâs crumbling estate, and as eerie, grim things start to happen, Violet begins to wonder about the boy living in her backyard. Is River just a crooked-smiling liar with pretty eyes and a mysterious past? Or could he be something more? (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12930909-between-the-devil-and-the-deep-blue-sea" target="_blank">via Goodreads</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Violet has a complicated relationship with the enigmatic stranger who calls himself River West, and I have a complicated relationship with this book. On the one hand, I can&#8217;t help but praise the genuine creepiness &#8212; these are some of the most well-crafted chills I&#8217;ve experienced in a while. But on the other hand, I have all these underlying issues with the characters and with the big plot twist that just leave me equal parts enraged and confused. <em>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</em> was on my list of highly anticipated releases this year, but now that I&#8217;ve finished reading I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2887"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I always like to start with the good stuff, so let&#8217;s talk about some things that go bump in the night. Specifically, let&#8217;s talk about things like small children creeping through graveyards carrying crosses, ghostly girls appearing in the moonlight, and red eyes burning in the darkness, because if you find these thrilling, then you&#8217;ll find plenty to love about this book. But wait, there&#8217;s more! For me, the most terrifying moments in the story had nothing to do with spectral visions or graveyards at midnight. The true source of fear is human nature itself, and the capacity for humans to be evil &#8212; to be evil and yet be well intentioned, which I think is a thousand times scarier. I feel like there are few things more disturbing than a person who hurts and manipulates others for what he or she believes is the greater good; they believe they&#8217;re providing a service and working miracles, but all the while they&#8217;re actions are causing others to suffer. Which brings us to one of the main conflicts in <em>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</em>: what is the definition of evil? Do the ends justify the means?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This conflict manifests itself in the form of River, a character who is portrayed as both intoxicating and extremely threatening. Violet is drawn to him from the start, which turned me off initially because it had all the makings of your usual Instalove romance and quite frankly I&#8217;ve had enough of those. Later developments in the plot made me rethink the Instalove part, but couldn&#8217;t get rid of the bad vibes between me and River. To be completely honest, I thought his supernatural abilities (which I won&#8217;t elaborate on) were a bit of a letdown once the truth was revealed. I think I was expecting something more. Which isn&#8217;t to say that those abilities aren&#8217;t unsettling enough as they are. But for me, River wasn&#8217;t swoon-worthy at all. I was mostly alternating between being perplexed by his character and wanting to shove him off a cliff. I guess I&#8217;m just not the kind of girl to be won over by his particular brand of charm. There is something so sinister lurking beneath the surface of River&#8217;s charisma, something sinister enough that it tainted even his better moments, and for that I think the author deserves credit. But was I in love with River? No. Did I think Violet should be in love with River? Nope. I see why she found him to be so irresistible, both before and after the big reveal, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I have to like it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for Violet, we don&#8217;t really get to know her that well. The real Violet recedes into the background once River arrives. Yes, we learn that Violet is an old soul who likes to wear her dead grandmother&#8217;s dresses and loves nothing more than curling up with a good book. She&#8217;s an artist and a coffee aficionado. She often feels misunderstood and left out, without any real friends (Sunshine doesn&#8217;t count) and lacking a connection with her twin brother. But who is Violet, really? I can&#8217;t tell. There IS a reason that partially explains why she&#8217;s such a flat character, and I accept that reason, but it isn&#8217;t enough for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m hiding my #1 issue with the book because I don&#8217;t want to spoil anyone who hasn&#8217;t read it yet. Only view the spoiler if you&#8217;ve finished the book in its entirety!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[View post to see spoiler]</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</em> is rich in Gothic charm (plus old-fashioned Gothic horror) and infused with an eerie atmosphere. There are a lot of questions floating around here about both human nature and the nature of evil, which I appreciated. I always like it when a book makes me think. But I had a lot of problems with the characters and the relationship between Violet and River, which soured the experience for me. Even worse was the ninja plot twist at the very end, which not only left me reeling (in a bad way, as in punching walls and throwing a massive tantrum) but also left me quite a bit disgusted. I mean, what a TERRIBLE plot twist. Words can&#8217;t even describe my disappointment at this turn of events. So, while I loved the horror bits and all the delicious creepiness of Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, and while I thought River&#8217;s complexity as a character was all kinds of interesting (if not likeable), I have to give this a mediocre &#8216;meh&#8217; sort of rating and I don&#8217;t see myself picking up any future installments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to the publisher for providing me with an ARC free of charge in exchange for an honest review!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Neil Gaiman</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, William Morrow Books &#8211; eBook, 246 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Childhood is far behind him, but the narrator of this tale still remembers the summer he was seven, when he met a girl named Lettie Hempstock and ended up on an adventure like no other. Harrowing, dangerous, and wonderful, the memory of that adventure has remained vivid even when other memories have grown dull with the passage of time. Reality and fantasy converge as he and Lettie uncover a darkness that has endured for ages and fight together to banish it for good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you ask me, there&#8217;s simply no one out there who can tell a story quite like Neil Gaiman. One of my favorite things about reading his books is that moment when the ordinary gives way to the magical and mysterious &#8212; the moment when you just know that you&#8217;ve stepped into a fairytale. I always get the chills, seriously. Every time it happens, I remember exactly why I love this author&#8217;s work so much. <em>The Ocean at the End of the Lane</em> was no exception.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3040"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I flew through this book, which was great because I&#8217;d been going through somewhat of a reading slump. Lately, while I&#8217;ve had no shortage of great books, very few have compelled me to finish reading in one sitting. This one is short (just over 200 pages), but the length had very little to do with how quickly I got through it. I just really wanted to know what was going on! I love that this was told from a child&#8217;s perspective. Actually, quite a few of my favorite Gaiman books are narrated by children, and I think he has this really good grasp on how to do that right. The children in his stories are often precocious, but not overly so; they have that air of mischief and blunt honesty that make them believable. (Ah, and <em>Coraline</em> fans: the villain of this story is every bit as creepy and menacing as the Other Mother!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrator here is actually a middle-aged man recalling the events of a summer long past, when he was seven years old. So you get that unique view of the world that can only be delivered by a small child, but you also get the added touch of hearing it from someone who is looking back, seeing that world from a different angle. There is a great deal of nostalgia in the telling, and so many undeniably <em>true</em> observations on childhood itself that it won&#8217;t matter how distant your own childhood might be &#8212; you&#8217;ll still find yourself getting nostalgic too. I feel like the book is, in a way, a celebration of being a child and of that time in your life when the world is so much more magical, when everything is still new and undiscovered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fantasy elements were superb, as to be expected from Neil Gaiman. There&#8217;s a lot of folklore and fairytale influence, and so many little touches seem familiar, but it&#8217;s always just on the tip of your tongue and you can never remember precisely which story that particular detail might have come from. Somehow, he always manages to make the most timeless bits and pieces of those stories seem entirely his own. But I think the best part about this book was that the mystery of the three Hempstocks is never fully explained. Why does their farm somehow converge on the strange and magical? How much of the narrator&#8217;s memory is really accurate, and how much of it is blurred by time, viewed through the lens of childhood long past? I loved that I never had a complete picture of who the Hempstocks were and what all the magic in this book could do. It made me feel like there was still wonder in the world. And that&#8217;s a pretty huge thing for someone like me to say, considering how fond I am of knowing the answers.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This modern fable is definitely on my list of favorites for the year (and for all time, really). I was so caught up in all the mystery that I wanted it to go on for longer than 200 or so pages. I love that Neil Gaiman is so incredibly good at conveying what the world must look like to a child, from the things that are unexpectedly eerie to the little details that remind you, as an adult, just how amazing the most ordinary occurrences can seem when you&#8217;re that age. Haven&#8217;t read much Neil Gaiman yet? I recommend <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16793.Stardust" target="_blank"><em>Stardust</em></a> (something I re-read every year just because), <a title="#50: The Graveyard Book" href="http://novelideareviews.com/50-the-graveyard-book/"><em>The Graveyard Book</em></a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14497.Neverwhere" target="_blank"><em>Neverwhere</em></a> and <a title="#9: Coraline" href="http://novelideareviews.com/9-coraline/"><em>Coraline</em></a> for starters!</p>
