				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/juggling.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3958 alignleft" alt="juggling" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/juggling-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a>This is a post about the fine art of juggling. Specifically, the fine art of juggling my never-ending TBR pile, being a grown up, trying to write a manuscript, answering the question, &#8220;Teacher, is it Halloween yet?&#8221; 12 billion times a day, figuring out what to do for dinner, editing a gigantic pile of photos from my last session, AND finding time to blog, all at the same time. As you might guess, it&#8217;s a little bit ridiculous. Also, it&#8217;s exhausting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">September was probably the craziest month we&#8217;ve ever had on the blog to date, and you may have noticed a drop in the number of posts here around that last week or so. To put it simply, life attacked with a vengeance. I caught this new and particularly ferocious cold/virus/THING right around then (thanks, preschool) and it also happened to be when Alix ended up completely slammed at work. We were skipping scheduled posts left and right, drafts remaining unwritten and growing cold and lonely on our calendar while we struggled to maintain equilibrium in our hectic offline lives. We were silent on Twitter. We let the blog slip into a state of temporary hibernation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3957"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was really hard on me because upkeep of this blog is a pretty big deal in my life. Through this blog, I&#8217;ve made friends and discovered amazing books and made a lot of really incredible memories. Running it with Alix is my #1 hobby, out of all my dozens of hobbies; it&#8217;s kind of like this crazy unpaid job that I&#8217;ve devoted countless hours to, and I know that a lot of you out there feel the same way. I think that&#8217;s why, when the latest Goodreads debacle took place recently, I well and truly felt slapped in the face.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I feel this way anytime book bloggers are accused of bullying, or being overly critical, or criticized themselves for (gasp!) having an opinion. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s fair, and here&#8217;s why: <em><strong>for so many of us, book blogging is a labor of love</strong></em>. We do this because we love books, because we have things to say about books, and because we want more than anything to share our love with the entire universe. At least, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m in it for. I don&#8217;t do this for money. I don&#8217;t do this because I&#8217;m bored &#8212; far from it. I have a pretty full plate over here. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m alone in saying that I blog because I love it, and I make time for it because of that. If it ever stops being fun, or if it ever starts to become more about what others think and want instead of what we think and want, I&#8217;ll be done blogging. Because that would render all of this pointless.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When book bloggers as a whole are put down for &#8220;bullying&#8221; and &#8220;author abuse&#8221; and other assorted crimes, I can&#8217;t help but wonder if all these people out there have any idea how much work we really put in &#8212; how much time and effort it takes, all the reading time we snag during lunch breaks and commutes because we committed to reviewing something, all the mental anguish when we love an author but not their book. The list goes on and on. I mean, it&#8217;s a complex equation. It doesn&#8217;t just amount to, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re mean because you didn&#8217;t like this book. You&#8217;re an awful, awful person and a bully as well.&#8221; I believe we have a right to express our feelings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And really, what it amounts to is that we will always say and do whatever we like on our blog, regardless of what others might think is right or wrong when it comes to book blogging. It&#8217;s our time that we&#8217;ve invested, in reading and writing up posts and coming up with features. We could be doing other things, but we choose to do this. I know a lot of you out there feel the same way. So don&#8217;t lose sight of the reason why you blog, whatever that reason might be. Keep it with you even when life is crazy and you can&#8217;t stick to your schedule. Remember it when you feel discouraged by negativity and lack of support. None of that stuff matters as long as you&#8217;re still doing something that makes you happy. At least, that&#8217;s how I see things.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What about you? Why do you blog, and how do you juggle life + blogging? Do you think there&#8217;s a lack of appreciation for book bloggers in the industry?</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Ack!! Sorry for the delay on this!! I&#8217;ve had a crazy week (and a half&#8230;?) since the last installment of this recap &#8212; first I caught the worst cold I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, then I was subsequently slammed with work and endless amounts of Grown-Up Responsibilities that ended up leaving no time at all for blogging. *sobs* Anyway, here is the fourth and final post in my Persuasion recap! If you missed the previous installments, here they are: <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank"><strong>Part I (Intro &amp; Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>, <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 2" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-2/" target="_blank"><strong>Part II (Chapters 8-12)</strong></a>, and <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 3" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-3/" target="_blank"><strong>Part III (Chapters 1-7)</strong></a>.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a> may be over, but Alix and I have decided that my <del>shenanigans</del> recaps will carry on as a feature on the blog! (This is the part where everyone runs away screaming.) So, at the end of this post I&#8217;m giving you a chance to tell me <strong>which Austen classic I should recap next</strong>! Please remember that with this great power comes great responsibility, et al etc.</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></span>: This is the grand finale of <em>Persuasion</em>, so brace yourself for ALL THE FEELS!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter Seven</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh snap! Mrs. Clay, are you now gunning for Cousin Elliott instead of Sir Walter??! You gold-digging minx, you! Not that this worked since Cousin E decided to go walking in the rain with Anne. Which, of course, is when Wentworth finally decides to come back into our story! (A wild Wentworth appears! SNORT) After seeing this other dude taking walks in the rain with Anne, Wentworth decides that he ALSO wants to do this. Plus he wants to show off his shiny new umbrella. But Cousin E interrupts the conversation, and a stroll with Anne is not in the cards for Wentworth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the days pass, Wentworth sightings continue to take place all around Bath. Even Lady Russell takes some time to stare at him. She covers this up by pretending to be staring at some really snazzy drawing room curtains instead. Smooth, Lady R. Anne says nothing about this but does make some private commentary on &#8220;the elegant stupidity of private parties.&#8221; Because she&#8217;s Anne, and sometimes snarky, even if she doesn&#8217;t ever say these things out loud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the end of the chapter, everyone is in full freak-out mode over an upcoming concert. Anne doesn&#8217;t really want to go&#8230; until she realizes that Wentworth might be there. #Gamechanger</p>
<p><span id="more-3678"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Wentworth does indeed attend the concert. He and Anne have a brief chat about Benwick and Louisa&#8217;s surprise engagement, during which Wentworth expresses his own concerns that the two aren&#8217;t alike enough. He can&#8217;t believe how easily Benwick got over his fiancee, the tragic Fanny Harville; &#8220;A man does not recover from such devotion of the heart to such a woman!&#8221; OH REALLY???? HMMMMMMMMMM</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, Wentworth adds that he does feel responsible for what happened to Louisa. Anne makes some sympathetic noises but mostly just shrugs and is like, &#8220;Ah, well, but I do hope I get to go back to Lyme someday cause that place was awesome. Just saying.&#8221; This is because she&#8217;s secretly rendered incoherent by Wentworth&#8217;s mini-speech about never being able to get over certain women one falls in love with. Is there hope in this awkward, angsty situation after all??!!! Except before any more of this riveting conversation can continue, Cousin Elliott appears on the scene and proceeds to go through with THE MOST UNWANTED INTERRUPTION OF ALL TIME. SERIOUSLY, DUDE?????</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A dismayed Anne watches Wentworth return to his own seat while Cousin Elliott starts confessing that he&#8217;s heard all sorts of lovely things about Anne and that he thinks very highly of her AND ALSO BTW I&#8217;M GOING TO SORT OF PROPOSE TO YOU NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CONCERT. (Yes, this happened.) Anne rendered speechless; resolves to flee ASAP. After intermission, she makes up her mind to go sit next to Wentworth and all the readers in the world stand up and just cheer for hours on end UNTIL COUSIN ELLIOTT COMES BACK TO RUIN THE MOMENT AGAIN DAMNIT GO AWAY JSKDHFKJSDHF</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SDHFFHJSGDFHJSFKJHDJKFH</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the days following the concert, Anne devotes all her energy to avoiding Cousin Elliott like the plague. She decides to visit her old friend Mrs. Smith, her former governess, who (if you remember from last installment) is now a destitute cripple but still a very sweet lady. She figures no one in her family, including Cousin E, would be caught dead consorting with destitute, crippled widows and that Mrs. Smith&#8217;s house is the safest place to hide right now. But when she gets there, Mrs. Smith starts being super weird about the whole Cousin E thing, going so far as to tell Anne that she expected to hear news of an engagement that day, and that she thinks Cousin E is a great guy, et al etc. Anne is confused and chooses to investigate further, whereupon Mrs. Smith suddenly pulls a complete 180 and condemns Cousin E as a Grade A Douchebag&#8230; what is going on??!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a considerable amount of hemming and hawing, Mrs Smith divulges that she has known Cousin E for quite some time. In fact, he used to be a very close friend of hers through her late husband, back when Cousin E was much less monetarily endowed and would come hang out with them/mooch off their food and hospitality all the time. Apparently he married his first wife (now also deceased) for her money rather than marrying Anne&#8217;s sister Elizabeth way back when. Mrs Smith produces an incriminating letter that proves what a lying, scheming, gold digging brigand Cousin Elliott really is. Behold, a list of his dastardly crimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assisted in ruining the Smith family finances, eventually leading to the demise of Mr. Smith and leaving Mrs. Smith a destitute, crippled widow.</li>
<li>Was the executor of Mr. Smith&#8217;s will, and yet refuses to assist Mrs. Smith in claiming property and money that is due to her and which might just reverse her fortunes.</li>
<li>Decided to re-insinuate himself in the Elliott family&#8217;s good graces when he realized that Mrs. Clay, that (fellow) conniving, gold-digging minx, had plans to try and marry Sir Walter. And lady, this town ain&#8217;t big enough for the both of us. /cue gunfight in Austen novel</li>
<li>Is now planning to foil Mrs. Clay&#8217;s marriage prospects AND marry Anne himself&#8230;!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After listening to all this, Anne realizes just how close she came to being persuaded YET AGAIN to make the wrong decision. If she&#8217;d listened to Lady Russell&#8217;s babbling about how awesome it would be to marry Cousin Elliott and become mistress of Kellynch Hall just like her mother used to be, Anne would be in the same capsizing ship all over again. She resolves to tell Lady R everything she&#8217;s just learned about the true depths of Cousin E&#8217;s utter douchebaggery.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like a true professional Queen Douchebag, Elizabeth manages to &#8220;send her love&#8221; to Lady Russell while simultaneously putting down her taste in books and ridiculing her fashion sense. Hey, this kind of jackass behavior takes skill, okay? Speaking of jackasses, Sir Walter tacks on HIS love to Lady Russell while also criticizing how disheveled she looks in the morning. Ah, the apple doesn&#8217;t fall far from the tree~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With perfect timing, another bad apple rolls into town &#8212; none other than our favorite crybaby hypochondriac, Mary! Right behind her are a bunch of the Musgroves visiting from Uppercross. Anne&#8217;s visit to Lady R is put off as she is pulled into social calls with the Musgroves and learns all about the upcoming weddings planned for Louisa and Henrietta. She is genuinely happy for both of the girls and mostly enjoys seeing everyone again (minus Mary, cause who would really want to see her??) but of course Wentworth soon arrives to have dinner with them all and brings a whole lot of Awkward with him. Anne and Wentworth are careful to stand on opposite sides of the room while secretly wrestling with inner turmoil. Mary, renowned busybody, happens to glance out the window and see some sort of furtive exchange going on between Mrs Clay and Cousin Elliott out on the street. This gets everyone talking about Anne and Cousin E; Anne is consequently upset that all of Bath seems to think she&#8217;s marrying that punk. Eeewwwwww.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the pleasure of watching Mary and her husband have another of their fun little marital squabbles, Sir William and Elizabeth crash the party in order to invite everyone to THEIR party on the following night. Because, appropriate.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the following day, Anne is hanging out at the hotel with the visitors from Uppercross. Mrs. Musgrove and Mrs. Croft (wife of Admiral Croft, tenant at the Elliott family&#8217;s estate, Kellynch Hall) are avidly discussing short engagements versus long engagements and seem to favor the latter option. Long engagements are apparently the worst idea ever. Wentworth pretends he isn&#8217;t listening. Pffftttt WHATEVER, WENTWORTH. Captain Harville (seafaring friend of Wentworth) randomly starts talking to Anne about his late sister Fanny, who was engaged to Benwick. He shows Anne a portrait of Benwick that had been commissioned for Fanny, but which is now being made over for Benwick&#8217;s new fiancee Louisa Musgrove. He laments that Fanny would not have &#8220;forgotten&#8221; Benwick as quickly as Benwick forgot about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anne agrees, and in her BEST speech ever in the whole book, she makes a fantastic argument basically stating that women do not forget love as easily as men do. Wentworth continues to pretend that he isn&#8217;t listening&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>BUT THEN HE PASSES HER A NOTE (MIDDLE SCHOOL STYLE) AND IT IS THE BEST NOTE EVER AND JUST EEEEEKKKKKKKKKKKK KJDHFKSJDHFKJSDHFKJSDFHKJSDHF THIS IS THE SOUND OF ME DYING OF THE FEELS</strong></h3>
<p>(in my notes this moment is marked by me writing the word <strong>EEEEEKKKKKKK</strong> in gigantic all-caps letters that take up like 5 lines)</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>***Pause for customary moment of unabashed flailing after being facepunched by feels***</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WENTWORTH AND ANNE RENEW THEIR ENGAGEMENT. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sir Walter finally writes this down in his precious book of the British Peerage (LOL). Lady Russell is made to writhe in agony as her long-ago prediction of doom and misfortune is proven COMPLETELY WRONG. Ha!!! Mary, of course, decides to take all the credit for her sister&#8217;s match with Wentworth but also suffers quite a bit of jealousy over Anne&#8217;s shiny new carriage. Cousin Elliott leaves Bath; and, since gold-digging birds of a feather flock together, it seems that Mrs. Clay has switched from chasing Sir Walter to chasing Cousin Elliott. Eeewwww. Despite feeling bad that she&#8217;s causing Wentworth to marry into a rather shitty family, Anne lives happily ever after with her beloved Wentworth (and a lifetime case of Wentworth Fever ;D). YAY HAPPY ENDING!!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">~ THE END ~</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Beautiful, clever, rich &#8211; and single &#8211; Emma Woodhouse is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage. Nothing, however, delights her more than interfering in the romantic lives of others. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3905 alignright" alt="austen_sensesensibility" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/austen_sensesensibility-191x300.jpg" width="115" height="180" /></a><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14935.Sense_and_Sensibility?from_search=true" target="_blank"><strong>Choice #2: <em>Sense &amp; Sensibility</em> by Jane Austen</strong></a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marianne Dashwood wears her heart on her sleeve, and when she falls in love with the dashing but unsuitable John Willoughby she ignores her sister Elinor&#8217;s warning that her impulsive behaviour leaves her open to gossip and innuendo. Meanwhile Elinor, always sensitive to social convention, is struggling to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. Through their parallel experience of loveâand its threatened lossâthe sisters learn that sense must mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Taken from the poverty of her parents&#8217; home, Fanny Price is brought up with her rich cousins at Mansfield Park, acutely aware of her humble rank and with only her cousin Edmund as an ally. When Fanny&#8217;s uncle is absent in Antigua, Mary Crawford and her brother Henry arrive in the neighbourhood, bringing with them London glamour and a reckless taste for flirtation. As her female cousins vie for Henry&#8217;s attention, and even Edmund falls for Mary&#8217;s dazzling charms, only Fanny remains doubtful about the Crawfords&#8217; influence and finds herself more isolated than ever.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.ca/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank"><strong>About Classics Retold</strong></a> | <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion/"><strong>Our Intro Post</strong></a></h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Why hello there! This is Part II of my (shenanigan-ized) chapter-by-chapter recap of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>, specifically designed with the Austen-Challenged in mind. For a complete breakdown of the important faces and places, as well as the first seven chapters, <strong><a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/">head over here to Part I</a></strong>!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-4149-aa55-843e-d0dd63d1b44d" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Because there is no justice in the world, Anne is now forced to hang out with Wentworth ALL THE DAMN TIME. The Musgroves all have Wentworth Fever and are constantly inventing new dinner parties, impromptu musical performances, and other crackpot schemes to invite him over. For Anne, itâs horrible suddenly being strangers when they used to be so close. The topic of the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son Richard is brought up; he was deemed inherently useless while still alive, but magically became awesome upon dying tragically young. Wentworth was his captain at sea and gets stuck listening to Mrs. Musgrove talking about how wonderful Richard was. He seems unconvinced of this, but only Anne notices. She continues to endure while Wentworth gives her the coldest cold shoulder ever in the history of cold shoulders.Â <strong>(Alix&#8217;s note: Wentworth is the biggest grudge holder ever. True story)</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-3674"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">A cousin of the Musgroves, Charles Hayter, returns to Uppercross only to discover that he is no longer the object of everyoneâs affections. Wentworth Fever <b>(AN: trademark)Â </b>rages on. Cousin Charles is rather upset by this turn of events, since he pretty much had an arrangement with Henrietta Musgrove that they would eventually marry and live happily ever after. This might still happen if anyone could get her to stop clinging to Wentworth for at least two seconds. Alas, Cousin Charles seems doomed to being ruthlessly friendzoned <strong>(AN: LOL Austen would have totally used that term had it existed back then)Â </strong>for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, Anne suffers in silence as Mary and her husband (you know, the OTHER Charles) <strong>(AN: not confusing at all)Â </strong>strike up lively discussions on which of the Misses Musgrove will end up marrying Wentworth. Mary is a horrible person and doesnât notice that this topic makes Anne want to hurl herself off the nearest cliff. And then, on a random visit, Wentworth witnesses Anne being plagued by one of her horrible nephews and handles it LIKE A BOSS. Anne marvels at his ability to wrangle disobedient children while simultaneously wondering if this /means/ anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The crazy love quadrangle between Wentworth, the Misses Musgrove, and Cousin Charles gets more intense every day. Anne, reluctant spectator, doesnât think that Wentworth is truly in love with either of the women. But she keeps this theory to herself, probably because she knows nobody ever listens to her anyway. One fine day, she gets roped into going on a forever long walk to nearby Winthrop, home of Cousin Charles. Everyone comes along, which means Anne gets to feel like the sixth or seventh wheel throughout. Yay. Louisa makes a melodramatic declaration about how sheâd rather end up dead in a carriage crash with her true love than remain at home without him <strong>(AN: even Austen had annoying tweens in her stories!)</strong>. Or something.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">While the others send Henrietta down to Winthrop to un-friendzone Cousin Charles, the group splits up and Anne accidentally eavesdrops on a conversation between Wentworth and Louisa. Wentworth makes a pointed speech about happy hazelnuts and how wishy-washy people are the worst ever. Anne, guilty of once being wishy-washy, feels ten billion times worse than before. But then Louisa starts ranting about how much Mary sucks as a sister-in-law and mentions that her brother almost married Anne instead. Louisa wishes that this event had taken place, but Anne turned down the proposal. Wentworth realizes that this happened not long after she broke the engagement with him. #Gamechanger</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">When the Crofts come along in their carriage, Wentworth endeavors to get Anne on board so she wonât have to walk all the way back to Uppercross with the rest of the circus. âShe understood him. He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling.â Or maybe he realized what a colossal jerk he was being and decided to take a break from that gig for a while, who knows.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Life is unfair, so Anne keeps getting roped into random trips and excursions that include Wentworth. This time itâs a seaside jaunt to the town of Lyme, which is apparently super awesome <strong>(AN: I just still a place that shares its name with a disease would be somewhere willingly want to go)</strong>. We meet Wentworthâs seafaring bros, Harville and Benwick, who both currently reside in Lyme. Benwick was engaged to Harvilleâs sister Fanny, but she died while he was at sea and plunged him into a never-ending spiral of despair. A great deal of Anneâs time is spent chatting with Benwick about brooding poetry and other emo things. In a classic Anne move, she tries to help him see the brighter side of things, but then wonders if she shouldnât practice what she preaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>Warning:</strong> This chapter was 10 different kinds of ridiculous.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne gets some admiring glances from a mystery man staying at the same innâ¦ who is later revealed to be none other than the estranged Elliott cousin, William Walter! You know, the guy whoâs inheriting Sir Walterâs title and estate. Also the one who was supposed to marry Elizabeth, but didnât. (Who could blame him? Sheâs awful.) Wentworth notices the admiring glances and PRETENDS like he isnât bothered by them. But I could totally tell. Nice try, dude.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Everyone goes gallivanting around town for one last hurrah before they need to head back to Uppercross. Anne is genuinely sad to be leaving &#8212; for once, she kinda had a good time. Chatting about emo poetry with Benwick is waaaay better than talking about A) who Wentworth is probably going to marry B) why Wentworth is so freaking awesome or C) Maryâs various imaginary ailments, so I get where sheâs coming from here. Harville thanks Anne for hanging out with Benwick; I bet it gave him a break from all the emo for a little while.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Louisa decides it would be great fun to go around leaping from dangerous heights. Wentworth tries to <em>persuade</em> her (see what I did there? SEE WHAT JANE AUSTEN DID THERE??) not to do it, but she wonât listen and ends up CRACKING HER HEAD OPEN.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Okay she didnât crack it open but she certainly cracked it at the very least. Everyone flips out because Louisa appears to be dead. I am flipping out cause WHAT!!!! As per usual only Anne manages to get a grip. Wentworth is having an aneurism of guilt and shame, but Anne is lucid enough (and awesome enough) to be like, âOh, what was that?? But I thought you didnât like women who were âwishy-washyâ and could be convinced to change their minds????? Not such a happy hazelnut anymore, are you??!!â But she doesnât say it out loud, of course, because Anne is a classy lady. I am not a classy lady, and therefore I was totally thinking the same thing AND saying it out loud.Â <strong>(AN: this entire paragraph is A+)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Musgroves split up, some staying with Louisa at the Harvillesâ house in Lyme while the others, including Anne and Wentworth, get the jolly task of telling the Musgrove parents that one of their daughters dashed her head open at the beach. Thus ends Part I of the book. /CLIFFHANGER</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s it for this week! Stay tuned for <strong>Part III of my <em>Persuasion</em> recap</strong>, coming next Saturday! And thanks everyone for your wonderful comments on last week&#8217;s post &#8212; you may be interested to know that I&#8217;ve decided to recap other Austen works in the future, since this feature got such a good reception. Also because Alix said so. Hahahaha <b>(AN: Yaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!)</b></h3>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-233a98cb-1f78-af09-553a-01aaef6c2353" style="text-align: justify;">Â I have no qualms about admitting that I donât read classics very often. Everyone around here should know by now that Iâm on this blog mainly to act as a notorious ringleader for all kinds of shenanigans. Classics arenât really shenanigan material, so they are more the domain of my much more poised and dignified co-blogger, Alix. HOWEVERâ¦ I know Iâm not the only one out there who shies away from classics. We all have our reasons; they can be pretty intimidating, certainly, and the writing style takes adjustment. (As well as perseverance, and other virtues I might be lacking. Err&#8230;)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But fear not, my friends! I, armed with almost ten pages of notes and a lot of iced coffee, have compiled the following Essential Guide to Jane Austenâs Persuasion for those of us who are Austen-Challenged. Um, and for those of us who like shenanigans. Iâll tell you everything you need to know in four perfectly manageable installments that wonât be taxing on your brain cells.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: This is intended for people who A) have read the book already or B) donât have issues with spoilers.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>ALSO IMPORTANT</strong>: This post is roughly 90% crack. And contains commentary by Alix</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THE BASICS</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Four years ago, Anne Elliott had a whirlwind romance with adorable sailor Frederick Wentworth. They were engaged, but Anne broke things off on the (terrible) advice of her (only) friend, Lady Russell. But now Wentworth is back, twice as awesome and successful as he was when he left. Anne never stopped loving him, Wentworth is still pissed, and things are about to get SUPER awkward.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span id="more-3619"></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>People You Should Know:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Anne Elliott</strong>, long-suffering heroine; surrounded by pretentious morons</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Captain Frederick Wentworth</strong>, hero and jilted fiancee; not bitter about this AT ALL</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Sir Walter Elliott</strong>, Anneâs father; self-appointed King of the DouchebagsÂ <strong>(A: LOL)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lady Elliott</strong>, Anneâs deceased mother; was super awesome, but unfortunately died</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Elizabeth Elliott</strong>, Anneâs older sister; self-appointed Queen of the DouchebagsÂ <strong>(A: double LOL)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mary Elliott Musgrove</strong>, Anneâs younger sister; crybaby hypochondriac</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lady Russell</strong>, Anneâs friend; responsible for giving the worldâs worst advice ever</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>William Walter Elliott</strong>, Anneâs cousin; shady individual who is also Sir Walterâs heir</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charles Musgrove</strong>, Anneâs brother-in-law; should be rewarded with medals for enduring marriage to a crybaby hypochondriac</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Admiral and Mrs. Croft</strong>, tenants of Kellynch Hall; should be rewarded with medals for all the times they donât punch their landlord (Sir Walter) in the face</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Louisa Musgrove</strong>, sister of Charles; pleasant, but impulsive</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Henrietta Musgrove</strong>, another sister of Charles; less impulsive, but still pleasant</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove</strong>, parents of Charles, Henrietta and Louisa; parents who actually love their children, GASP</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charles Hayter</strong>, cousin of the Musgroves; the 50th person in this book to be named CharlesÂ <strong>(A: It&#8217;s Austen&#8217;s way of keeping readers on their toes!)</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mr. Bennick</strong>, one of Wentworthâs sailor friends; heartbroken, likes brooding poetry</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Captain Harville</strong>, another of Wentworthâs sailor friends; worries that Bennick reads too much brooding poetry</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Fanny Harville</strong>, Bennickâs deceased fiancee; tragically died while he was at sea and is the reason why he reads brooding poetry</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mrs. Smith</strong>, formerly Anneâs governess; one of the few Anne fans out there</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Mrs. Clay</strong>, friend of Elizabethâs; widow suspected of being a scheming, gold-digging minx</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Places You Should Care About:</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Kellynch Hall</strong> &#8211; The Elliott estate. In a shambles because Sir Walter is terrible at managing his finances.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Uppercross</strong> &#8211; Residence of the Musgroves, Anneâs family through her sisterâs marriage.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Camden Place</strong> &#8211; The Elliott townhouse in the seaside town of Bath, where they are forced to move when they rent out Kellynch Hall.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Lyme</strong> &#8211; Another charming seaside town; home of the Harvilles and Mr. BennickÂ <strong>(A: I cannot help but always call lyme disease&#8230; SEE I CAN BE SILLY TOO!)</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PART I</span></h2>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter One</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We meet the Elliotts of Kellynch Hall, most of whom are snobby and unpleasant, with the notable exception of Anne. Naturally, since sheâs nothing like the rest of her family, they donât think much of her at all. Sir Walter, the family patriarch, is exceedingly vain and doesnât think highly of people he deems less attractive than himself. Also obsessed with social rank &amp; the British Peerage. He and eldest daughter Elizabeth are like two peas in a pod. They are incurable spendthrifts who have drained the estateâs finances, leaving the Elliotts with little choice but to rent out Kellynch Hall. The third Elliott sister, Mary, got married a while ago and lives not so far away at Uppercross with her husband.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne spends most of her time having to deal with her hateful family, but perseveres in being patient and kind anyway. Even so, she still ranks dead last on her fatherâs list of favorite people, because he is a jerk. The only person who seems to appreciate her is Lady Russell, who was a friend of her motherâs.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">We also learn of a cousin named William Walter Elliott (henceforth to be referred to as Cousin Elliott to minimize confusion) who will be inheriting Kellynch Hall and the title when Sir Walter dies. Apparently he is a despicable human being who talked smack about the Elliotts and then married someone else instead of Anneâs sister, Elizabeth. #Scandal</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Two</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is decided that the Elliotts must rent Kellynch Hall in order to avoid losing it forever, since they donât have the money for upkeep anymore. Sir W and Elizabeth are convinced by their solicitor and Lady R to move to the seaside town of Bath. Anne isnât thrilled about this, but no one cares what she thinks. Tagging along to Bath is Mrs. Clay, their solicitorâs widowed daughter, who is good friends with Elizabeth but not someone Lady R thinks very highly of.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Three</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Potential tenants are found for Kellynch Hall: Admiral Croft and his wife. The solicitor advises Sir W that a naval officer would be a fantastic choice to rent the estate due to their many virtues, plus it would be a good cover-up for the real reasons why the Elliotts are having to move away (i.e. Sir W sucks at managing money). Sir W expresses his wariness of seafaring men, who are often A) enterprising individuals who actually work for a living in order to succeed in life and B) not very attractive according to his high standards. <strong>(A: he is such a superficial douche king)</strong>Â He also doesnât want the future tenants to have access to the entire estate because he is, as you might have guessed by now, kind of an ass.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Four</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">It is revealed that Admiral Croftâs wife is also the sister of none other than Anneâs former love, Frederick Wentworth. Cue angst and initial waves of awkwardness as Anne realizes that this means their paths are very likely to cross again in the near future. Ever since taking Lady Râs (awful) advice to break off the engagement, Anne has never been the same.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Five</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The Crofts are approved to rent Kellynch Hall and the Elliotts prepare for their move to Bath. Once again, ainât nobody got time for Anneâs feelings. Younger sister and total drama queen Mary whines at Anne to come to Uppercross and take care of her during yet another of her (imaginary) bouts of illness. Meanwhile, Elizabeth makes it plain that she could care less what Anne does or where she goes.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">But because Anne is a good person, she takes precious time out of her busy and productive life to attempt to warn her mean sister that Mrs. Clay might not be in this for her friendship. In fact, Anne suspects Mrs. Clay is only being friendly because she has plans to marry Sir Walter and become the new Lady Elliott <strong>(A: dun-dun-dunnnn!)</strong>. Elizabeth shoots this idea down on the basis that Mrs. Clay is ugly, has freckles for crying out loud, plus have you seen her unfortunately weird tooth?? <strong>(A: *dies laughing*)Â </strong>Anne shrugs and moves on with a clear conscience. I mean, at least she tried.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Six</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne arrives at Uppercross, home of her sister Mary and brother-in-law Charles, as well as the rest of the Musgroves and Anneâs obnoxious little nephews. We discover that Mary is a total hypochondriac and also has questionable parenting skills (or lack thereof.) Almost immediately, Anne becomes the person everyone dumps their problems on. Sheâs just such a good listener. We meet the rest of the Musgroves, who are a much more pleasant bunch than the Elliotts are. Meanwhile, Admiral and Mrs. Croft move in over at Kellynch Hall and come to Uppercross for a visit. It is announced that the day of Anneâs doom is swiftly approaching: Mrs. Croftâs brother, Captain Wentworth, is indeed returning to England after spending a few years having adventures on the high seas. Coincidentally, he was Captain of the ship where the Musgrovesâ delinquent youngest son, Richard, was assigned before he died. Itâs a small world after all.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne is saved at the last minute when one of her obnoxious nephews conveniently breaks his collarbone, thus derailing plans for a social engagement where Captain Wentworth will be present. Mary and Charles saddle her with their injured offspring and frolic over to the Musgrovesâ main estate to meet Wentworth anyway. Anne is relieved that she doesnât have to face him just yet.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The next day, Anne is forced to endure widespread squee-ing and giddiness over Captain Wentworthâs apparent hotness. Both of Charlesâ young, single, and perfectly pleasant sisters now have massive crushes on him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Anne manages to avoid Wentworth several more times, but they meet again at last when he comes for an unexpected visit to Uppercross. This encounter is mercifully brief, and she is extremely glad when itâs over. But later, Mary tells Anne about a conversation she had with Wentworth in which he declared that Anne is, âchanged beyond recognition.â Anne is sucker punched in the face AND SO AM I. <strong>(A: he is unfortunately a douche for saying that)Â </strong><em>Ouch</em>, Wentworth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">âShe had given him up to oblige others. It had been the effect of over-persuasion. It had been weakness and timidity.â</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1117" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today marks my 6 month anniversary as a book blogger! I can hardly believe that it&#8217;sÂ <em>already</em> andÂ <em>only</em> been 6 months since Paola asked me to reviewÂ <em><a title="The Ashford Affair" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-ashford-affair/">The AshfordÂ AffairÂ </a></em>which led to my officially joining A Novel Idea as a full time reviewer.Â It&#8217;s been a crazy adventure ever since!</p>
<div id="attachment_3539" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6monthsbookblogging.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3539  " title="From Getty Images" alt="6monthsbookblogging" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6monthsbookblogging.jpg" width="250" height="167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca/" target="_blank">Getty Images</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve been online in some form or another (whether running a fan site, personal blog, private blog, community moderator) since I was a young teenager in the early 90s (I refuse to do the math because it has been <em>that</em> long). Yes I remember the days of dialup and having a limited amount of hours per month of internet connection time. My first site was built in an Angelfire WYSIWYG editor and I was so proud when I moved on to Geocities&#8217;Â WYSIWYG! Eventually through the awesome (at the time) site <em><a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/" target="_blank">Lissa</a>Â </em><em><a href="http://www.lissaexplains.com/" target="_blank">Explains It All</a>Â </em>I learned how to code basic HTML websites. I even had a domain where I had a bunch of fan sites and even hostees! While I was never a &#8220;big&#8221; name in the online worlds I traveled in, I found a place for myself and made friendships that endure to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then I started university and my online presence pretty much disappeared.Â I had a public personal blog that I had been keeping for years and where I did some pretty kick ass design/coding considering my next to zero knowledge but decided to let it go. I had kept a private, restricted blog going but shut down my public facing online life. I loved being online and creating/managing sites but I had lost interest in the subjects of my fan sites and I&#8217;m also a very private person so having a personal blog was never the right fit. Flash forward 6 years! I found myself with free time thanks to a new job and feeling the pull of going back to blogging. I started a lifestyle blog. I put so much into it but was never really able to do what I wanted with it. I had all these grand ideas but by then, HTML had progressed so far that I felt lost in it and I simply had different priorities (ie.: choosing to spend time with friends and family vs figuring out coding). I couldn&#8217;t keep up with regular posting and it just wasn&#8217;t a satisfying experience. While all of this was happening, I had joined an online book club that included Paola.</p>
<p><span id="more-3435"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m gonna back track a little now. I&#8217;ve always loved reading. It&#8217;s alway played a huge part in my life. I was so excited when I finally finished uni and realized I had time again toÂ <em>read things I wanted to</em>! Over the years I&#8217;ve been in 3 RL book clubs and 2 online ones (including the now defunct one where I met Paola). But for some reason, I had never thought about blogging about it (even though I ran the site for one of my RL book clubs). I read book blogs and loved books but I never made the link that it could be something I could do and enjoy until Paola asked me to join A Novel Idea. I haven&#8217;t looked back since.</p>
<div id="attachment_3556" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6monthsbookblogging2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3556 " alt="From Getty Images" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/6monthsbookblogging2.jpg" width="250" height="237" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">From <a href="http://www.gettyimages.ca/" target="_blank">Getty Images</a></p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Book blogging has been a challenge, I won&#8217;t lie. Those first couple of months when I started using NetGalley to request ARCs, I would request all the books I found interesting and found myself more then once overwhelmed with having to read and write reviews for books that I had time to read. And yes, there were a few books which I didn&#8217;t end up reviewing either because I didn&#8217;t have time, I didn&#8217;t find them interesting or missed the archive date.Â Over the months I&#8217;ve learned to better balance ARCs, my TBR pile and reviews. I&#8217;m far from feeling like I&#8217;ve found the perfect balance but it&#8217;s not as overwhelming as it used to be. Paola has been awesome at supporting me through this and telling it&#8217;s okay to not review a book.Â I&#8217;ve also struggled with the fact that I don&#8217;t review genres that are as popular here&#8230; This isn&#8217;t a complaint; I full intended on converting all of you to contemporary YA (if I can convert Paola, I can convert anyone), New Adult and Romance &amp; Chick Lit!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best part of book blogging has been by far getting to know more people, especially Paola! She is such an awesome lady and I wouldn&#8217;t be doing this if it weren&#8217;t for her support. Blogging isÂ <em>hard</em> in a good and rewarding way and doing it with someone else makes it more fun and less stressful! I&#8217;m also slowly getting to know more of you via Twitter, which is great. I&#8217;ve also gotten the chance to learn about books I might have never heard of before and be able to discuss so many various things with all of you, most book related, some not (*coughROYALScough*). Book blogging has been a creative outlet in a way for me and has become not just a hobby but something I truly love doing and hope to grow more into.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve also set goals for myself as a book blogger for the next 6 months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to work on finding a better balance between ARCs and my TBR pile. I&#8217;ve felt like I&#8217;ve really neglected some books I&#8217;ve been meaning to read in favour of ARCs and I want to be able to enjoy both my reading lists equally.</li>
<li>Work on my reviewing style and voice. Paola likes calling me the &#8220;classy&#8221; reviewer cause I don&#8217;t tend to ramble as much as her (FYI I don&#8217;t believe that at all!) but I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s me or not. I&#8217;m still searching for my reviewing voice but I feel like I&#8217;m making good progress!</li>
<li>Not be bothered by the fact that my posts get no or few comments. It&#8217;s rough putting so much time into something and not getting much feedback or comments. It&#8217;s something Paola has been great at reminding me isn&#8217;t the end of the world.</li>
<li>Setting aside more time to blog in the week like if this was a job (a job that is totally awesome!).</li>
<li>Get better acquainted with the awesome book blogger network A Novel Idea has! I know you guys know Paola pretty well; she&#8217;s more on Twitter then I am and is the commenting queen! I&#8217;m quite shy (more so online then in RL strangely enough) so I get intimated (which I know is crazy since you&#8217;re all so nice and friendly!).</li>
<li>Generally get more involved in the book blogging community. I&#8217;ll be participating in my first ever solo event in November, the Sci-fi month event hosted at <a href="http://www.rinnreads.co.uk/2013/08/sci-fi-month-update.html" target="_blank">Rinn Reads</a>! I&#8217;m super excited (and a little bit scared &#8211; hahaha)!</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to what the future holds for me as a book blogger! I&#8217;m hoping to eventually attend BEA andÂ <strong>finally meet PaolaÂ </strong>(yes we have never met in person before)! I hope this post gave you guys some insight into who I am a little more since I know I&#8217;m the ~mysterious~ one here. :)</p>
<h2>What about you? How long have you been blogging? What have you loved and found difficult about it? What are your goals as a book blogger? Got any questions for me?</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-78e60601-dcbc-beea-999a-8bdd7d729ce5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coping.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3506" alt="coping" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coping-226x300.jpg" width="203" height="270" /></a>Few bookish experiences are more excruciating than the gap between one installment of a series and the next. Here you are, completely entangled in the assorted adventures and misadventures of a cast of characters youâve been following for quite possibly yearsâ¦ and now you have to WAIT.</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I meanâ¦ what???</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I know. Itâs painful, but we can do this. Here are some (tried and true) coping strategies for anyone currently stuck in that mystical limbo land between series release dates. Read through them, absorb their wisdom, and then come find me in my corner where Iâm sobbing like a moron and clutching my copy of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167166-crown-of-midnight" target="_blank"><em>Crown of Midnight</em></a>, still crushed into a pulp by the intense feels. (I <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/crown-of-midnight/" target="_blank">reviewed it</a> earlier today &#8212; go see sordid evidence of the giant pulpy mess that is my heart right now.)</h3>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #1: Weep profusely and with abandon</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thatâs right, get all those tears out of your system. All you need for this exercise is you, your tear ducts, and ALL THE FEELS. Plus some frustration. Iâm sure you have these things. Curl up in your favorite self-pitying spot and cry until you canât cry anymore. Optional materials: a pint of Ben &amp; Jerryâs and/or your battered old teddy bear from the good old days when you still slept with a night light. (Or maybe you still sleep with a night light. I wonât judge.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3505"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #2: Go back to square one</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By this, I mean read everything all over again, starting from the first book. You donât want to let go of these characters, right? Youâre not ready to put them away for the next few months or even a full year, are you??? Okay then. In all honesty, I like to do this if I can because I tend to blaze through the newest book in my rush to find out what happens. When I read it the second time, I can go slower and really pay attention instead of biting my nails and going, âEEEEKK!!!â every few paragraphs. Besides, now you know what happens. You can take it easy, maybe even come through with some deep thoughts. And maybe this time youâll take that massive facepunch to the feels with your shoulders thrown back and your feet squarely planted on the ground. Go on. Make me proud, tiger.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #3: Find a support group</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">No, really. Chances are, there will be others in the wide world of book lovers who feel the same way you do. Thatâs the beauty of this thing called book blogging (and the Internet in general). It used to be really hard for me to find someone who would understand the burning need to flail around and keysmash in all caps over a story, but now all I have to do is hit up Twitter or Goodreads. Case in point: I have an excellent #PostFinnikinSupportGroup. We help each other survive the crippling emotions caused by Melina Marchettaâs books, invent ridiculous hashtags together, and writhe in agony simultaneously when necessary.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #4: Make a soundtrack to go with your misery</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Then put it on infinite loop while you troll the Internet for fanart, fanfiction and all manner of ways to express the feelings churning through your broken heart. (These coping strategies sound alarmingly like post-breakup adviceâ¦ errâ¦) Many authors make playlists to go with their books, so use those as a starting point if you have to. There is something oddly therapeutic about driving home from work choking back sobs as you relive the epic highs and lows of the series through music. Itâs not pathetic, promise.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #5: Distract yourself with different reading material</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">No, youâre not cheating on your true love. Youâre just taking a break. Sure, itâs going to feel a lot like a love triangle, but you need some air. Take a vacation to another world, one populated with yet more characters who will steal your soul and keep it locked in a box by their bed. No one ever said you had to be exclusive. And then, when THAT series comes grinding to a halt while the next installment is still being written, you can move on again! I wonât tell. Just make eye contact with that book (or books) and say, âDonât hate the player, hate the game.â Or something equivalent. Then walk away with your head held high because they can smell fear. YOU ARE IN CONTROL HERE.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; There is a sixth hidden option, which is to be totally mature and just wait it out without the above hysterics taking place. Iâm not listing it because I donât really believe itâs possible.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Have a coping strategy to add to the list? Itâs important that you tell me. I have to document these things.</strong></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Brought to you by <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte @ Gypsy Reviews</a> + <a href="http://novelideareviews.com" target="_blank">Paola @ A Novel Idea</a>!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-31da4215-99d3-3edc-5c59-d9f13b430940" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: This event came into being one day when Charlotte and I were brainstorming some collab ideas for our two blogs. It occurred to us that, as Asian readers, it was very rare for us to find YA books that represented our culture. Asian settings and characters in the genre are pretty rare, and not always authentic or even anything we could identify with. Whereâs the love, people??</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Well, for the next three days, weâre bringing you all kinds of Asian Awesomeness. Itâs a celebration of books that showcase the depth and diversity of Asia, from fantasy with a touch of the Far East to historical fiction that brings those cultures to life. (And weâll probably also talk about Mulan, because letâs face it &#8212; sheâs a total badass.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Today, though, we&#8217;d like to take the liberty of debunking some common stereotypes that have made their way into literature and film. Because, you know, we&#8217;re experts.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3098"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #1: ALL ASIANS ARE FREAKISHLY SMART</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: There are so many typical Asian stereotypes found in books and movies and they are not true at all! First of all we have the Asians are Smart stereotype which bugs me so much because not all Asians are smart to that extent. Asians are just like any other people, weâre not all geniuses or whatever. It all really boils down to how in our culture, we emphasise more on studies and doing well in school, therefore weâre more inclined to study more and get good grades. So itâs not all intelligence, just our willingness to do well.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Want a fantastic example of why this is a myth?? I&#8217;m Asian and I ABSOLUTELY SUCK AT MATH. Like, beyond belief. I hate it so much. I declared it as my nemesis when I was in first grade and it just went downhill from there. Not all Asians are capable of calculating complex equations and chemical reactions within milliseconds. Some of us are total dunces at that stuff. Some of us (i.e. myself) are better at being Disney Princesses and herding preschoolers from Point A to Point B. So next time you need tutoring, nabbing the nearest Asian person may not be the solution.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #2: ALL ASIANS ARE THE SAME</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: I hate when Asians are just kind of massed together, like all our various cultures, beliefs, backgrounds and ENTIRELY SEPARATE COUNTRIES can all be lumped together and labeled as the same general thing. There is so much diversity that people often seem to perceive as nothing more than an amorphous blob. No, we&#8217;re not all the same. Different parts of Asia yield different customs and traditions. For someone like me with a mixed Asian heritage (Filipino/Chinese), it becomes even more complex.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Also what really bothers me is when people get mixed up between Chinese and Japanese. They are not the same when you talk about Chinese characters and kanji which is more for Japanese. Kanji is basically Chinese characters that have the same meaning as the Chinese characters but they are pronounced differently.. Kanji is only Japanese. Chinese characters are called han zi (æ±å­). So please do not confuse the two because they are two entirely different languages! It really bothers me when people mix these two languages up especially when people call kanji Chinese &gt;&lt;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #3: ALL ASIAN PARENTS ARE TERRIFYING</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Not sure if all of you remember but when the Tiger Mum released her article for her book and revealed how she reared her daughters, a lot of people were quite shocked. It was quite shocking for me as well because her ways were very restricting. People probably got the idea that all Asian parents are this strict. Not true, it all really depends on the parentâs way of raising their child, some may choose to be more liberal and some more strict. Just because one parent does it, does not mean all Asian parents are like this.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: I mean, MY parents were pretty frightening at times (err, they still are), but they were definitely not as crazy as that lady. I think many Asian cultures share a system of values, and quite a few of those values don&#8217;t have the same importance in Western cultures. This is why it seems like Asian parents are much more strict. It&#8217;s true that my parents had very high expectations of me, and very true that they have their Asian-specific quirks that come from our culture, but no one was forcing me to practice the violin until my fingers bled or anything. Wow, that sounded kinda like a horror movie&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #4: ALL ASIANS ARE TINY &amp; ADORABLE</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Guess what? Some of us are tall. I&#8217;M not tall, per se, but I have a cousin who&#8217;s almost 7 ft. and possibly still growing. Oh, but this myth is only partially debunked because Charlotte and I are <em>totally</em> adorable.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></strong></span>: YES THIS. Iâm considered tall, around 167cm (5.6ft I think?) and taller than most of my peers so this is debunked! That being said maybe most of the people I know are shorter than meâ¦ but at least not all Asians are tiny! Also yes, totally agree with Paola weâre adorable ;D *flashes my best smile*</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #5: ASIANS ARE BEST IN SUPPORTING ROLES</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: Asians, or POC in general, in books and movies are usually delegated as âsupporting charactersâ only. Itâs a pretty common stereotype and I would love to see more Asians in main roles, I mean look at Mulan! She got a main role ;D Though people who donât call her a princess are rawrrrr, she saved China you guys, an entire country. Which Disney princess has done that eh? So she deserves that title haha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: Which brings us to&#8230;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">MYTH #6: MULAN SHOULD NOT BE A DISNEY PRINCESS</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: *points to Charlotte&#8217;s statement above* HELLO, REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAVED ALL OF CHINA??? PLUS she&#8217;s a beast at chess, an avid equestrienne, is capable of inventing ingenious ways to feed the chickens, <a href="http://31.media.tumblr.com/290cda9649be03c2cd032db1ed6bc09c/tumblr_mqz4ubBAeZ1s20r7so1_500.gif" target="_blank">CUT HER HAIR OFF WITH A SWORD</a>&#8230; need I say more??? I remember being so excited when I realized that the next Disney heroine was going to look more like me than any of the others introduced previously. It meant a lot to this little girl to have a resilient, independent, clever female character to look up to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6f152e;"><strong>CHARLOTTE</strong></span>: I might be a little biased because I feel like I can relate to her, being Asian and all. But her values, such as being afraid to not live up to her parents and fail them is a very real fear. I love that sheâs so motivated in the end and strives to become a soldier and show that she is just as capable as the rest of the men. Mulan works hard and pushes on, she doesnât give up even when everyone is telling her she should. Sheâs such a strong female character and I look up to her so much, sheâs truly a fantastic role model :3</p>

In the spirit of all those good old-fashioned Xanga/MySpace surveys that were so popular in the days of our youth, here&#8217;s an (alphabetical) account of our reading habits :) If you did the survey too, please leave us a link so we can come read your post!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">A</span></strong>uthor you&#8217;ve read the most books from:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Laura Ingalls Wilder. I&#8217;ve been a <em>Little House</em> fan since childhood and own multiple dog-eared, practically-falling-apart copies of the books in the series. Close contenders would be Robin McKinley, J.K. Rowling, Diana Wynne Jones and Sarah Dessen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- I would it&#8217;s Jane Austen since I read all of her novels (from first published to last!) back-to-back after receiving the Complete Works compilation book in high school! Closely followed by Henning Mankel (excellent Swedish crime novels!), Meg Cabot (I&#8217;ll basically read anything by her and practically have), J.K. Rowling (just missing her pen name book to have read all her works!), Ann M. Martin (<i>The Baby-Sitters Club</i>!),</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">B</span></strong>est sequel ever:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Oh man, this is a tough question. I don&#8217;t usually like sequels at all, especially not the ones that are Book 2 in a trilogy. I guess I&#8217;d have to say <a title="Froi of the Exiles" href="http://novelideareviews.com/froi-of-the-exiles/"><em>Froi of the Exiles</em></a> by Melina Marchetta, because going back to Lumatere could never be wrong. Err, except I never actually left&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix -</strong> <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6148028-catching-fire" target="_blank">Catching Fire</a></em> is one of those rare 2nd-in-a-series books that outdid the first and final book for me. It is my favourite book in the series. I devoured it and for me, it was best the written, most powerful and feeling causing book in the Hunger Games series.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">C</span></strong>urrently reading:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Um, like 12 books at once? I&#8217;m incapable of selecting one book to read at a time. Right now I&#8217;m juggling <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9741685-shadows-on-the-moon" target="_blank"><em>Shadows on the Moon</em></a> by Zoe Marriott (AMAZING), <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl" target="_blank"><em>Fangirl</em></a> by Rainbow Rowell (ALSO AMAZING) and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16113606-of-beast-and-beauty" target="_blank"><em>Of Beast &amp; Beauty</em></a> by Stacey Jay (a truly unique take on the <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> fairytale).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- Nothing&#8230; I KNOW! My life has been so crazy for the 2 weeks that I didn&#8217;t start another book after finished my last. Since I&#8217;m always reading a bunch of books at once I&#8217;m technically readingÂ <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7801229-the-exiled-queen" target="_blank"><em>TheÂ ExiledÂ Queen</em></a> by Cinda Williams Chima and <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497.A_Feast_for_Crows" target="_blank">A Feast for Crows</a></em> by George R.R. Martin but haven&#8217;t touched them in the last couple of weeks. I&#8217;m super looking forward to starting Fangirl this week though!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3338"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">D</span></strong>rink of choice while reading:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- An iced mocha. Sooooo good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- COFFEEEEEEEE!!!! *cough*</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">E</span></strong>-Reader or physical book?</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Hmm, it depends. Some books just NEED to be read in their physical format and for some reason are more satisfying that way. But most of the time I prefer ebooks because they&#8217;re convenient, portable, and I can highlight the shit out of them. (I&#8217;ve been known to take photos of pages in books with my phone because I can&#8217;t highlight library copies&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- E-Reader mostly because of practically reasons. As I mentioned in our <a title="Reading Overseas: Part I" href="http://novelideareviews.com/reading-overseas-part-1/">ReadingÂ Overseas</a> interview, it&#8217;s easier for me to get ebooks in English then physical books (unless I buy them). I do still prefer physical books but my e-reader just makes it easier and also very much appeals to my book ADD! That being said, I was quite distraught that I didn&#8217;t have a physical book with me when my Kobo died during my commute awhile back! #lessonlearnedthehardway</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">F</span></strong>ictional character you probably would&#8217;ve actually dated in high school:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Oh geez. &#8211; insert name of self-centered douchebag character here &#8211; I was kind of a magnet for boy problems in high school. I wish I could say they&#8217;d all been Dessen boys, haha. (A little Wes or Owen would&#8217;ve been nice!!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- Considering I didn&#8217;t date any guys in high school this a easy/hard one to answer&#8230; Though knowing my track record with guys post-HS, I would say that unfortunately it would be one of those artistic/musical type guys that end up breaking your heart. P</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">G</span></strong>lad you gave this book a chance:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Speaking of Wes, my answer for this one would have to be <a title="The Truth About Forever" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-truth-about-forever/" target="_blank"><em>The Truth About Forever</em></a> by Sarah Dessen. Totally not into contemporary, but this was the book that made me more willing to try the genre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- In general it would <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5972874-prelude-to-foundation" target="_blank">Prelude to Foundation</a></em> byÂ Isaac Asimov. A good friend recommend it to me after I found myself for the first time in my life with spare time to read. I had never read anything sci-fi before and although I loved sci-fi tv shows, I thought the books were too &#8220;geeky&#8221; for me. Boy was I wrong! I absolutely lovedÂ <em>Prelude to Foundation</em> and it opened up the door to me to read more sci-fi novels since, which some are now all-time favourites of mine. YA-wise, it would beÂ <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games" target="_blank">The Hunger Games</a>.</em> Before reading it, I had only dabbled in YA as an adult; I had read <em>Twilight</em> and the <em>Pretty Little Liars</em> series and while I had enjoyed them, it was <em>The Hunger Games</em> that made me realize just how good and impactful YA can be and made me seek out the genre actively in my reading life.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">H</span></strong>idden Gem book:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank"><em>Vessel</em></a> by Sarah Beth Durst, hands down. This book is amazing. The heroine is one of my favorites of all time &#8212; she&#8217;s got just enough sass, survival instinct, and wit. I want to be Liyana when I grow up. If you&#8217;re a fantasy fan and haven&#8217;t given this a try, WHY NOT?? Cause I&#8217;m pretty sure I told you to go get it when I wrote <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/">my review</a>. *glares*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/205057.Secret_Society_Girl" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Society Girl</em></a> book series byÂ Diana Peterfreund. You want to know what New Adult is all about? And how it should read when it&#8217;s done well? Then this is the series for you! There are 4 books in the series and they are ALL so good! Amy is a flawed, awesome and related college student navigating the waters of growing up and figuring out post college life WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SECRET SOCIETY! How can you NOT want to read that? Witty dialogues, a nice mix of real life drama and a little over-the-top drama (in a good way), hot guys, amazing friends, exotic locations! This series has it all!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I</strong></span>mportant moment in your reading life:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- When I learned how to walk to the library by myself in third grade. I&#8217;d go every weekend and sometimes after school, just to sit in the stacks and read whatever I got my hands on. That was the first time I ever realized how much of an escape reading could be, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-Â When I realized I could read in English. I know this might sound weird but having grown up going to school in French, I was never formally thought to read English beyond my mother reading English books to me. Then one night during story time, I started reading a page and both my mom and I were kinda shocked to piece together that somehow along the way, I had learned from her how to read. This opened up the world of English literature and being able to read in both English and French has been amazing for me!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">J</span></strong>ust finished:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642661-belle-epoque" target="_blank"><em>Belle Epoque</em></a> by Elizabeth Ross. But my review doesn&#8217;t go up until next Friday, so I&#8217;ll keep quiet about it for now~</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- <i>Rush Me</i> by Allison Parr. An excellent NA book I read in one sitting (oops!). Needless to say I loved it but to know why you&#8217;re going to have to read my review&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">K</span></strong>ind of books you won&#8217;t read:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- I&#8217;m willing to try most anything, but I don&#8217;t read very much heavy science fiction and tend to avoid crime novels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- I&#8217;m willing to give almost any genre a try although being a scaredy-cat, I tend to avoid full on horror novels (sorry Stephen King!).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">L</span></strong>ongest book you&#8217;ve read:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Ugh, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1215032.The_Wise_Man_s_Fear" target="_blank"><em>The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear</em></a> by Patrick Rothfuss. It was like 900+ pages. And while I loved the first book, this one just did NOT work for me. While we&#8217;re on the topic, though, another fantasy must-read is <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/186074.The_Name_of_the_Wind" target="_blank"><em>The Name of the Wind</em></a>. Trust me, with the first installment, the length is well worth it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7013345-a-storm-of-swords" target="_blank">A Storm of Swords</a></em> by George R.R. Martin at 1,074 pages! It took me to few hundred pages to get into it but once I did, boy did I ever! I have read much shorter books that have felt longer to read then this one did. Worth every page to get to the devastating end (if you watched season 3 of Game of Thrones you know what I&#8217;m talking about).</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">M</span></strong>ajor book hangover because of:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>FINNIKIN OF THE ROCK</em></a>. I ran around my house screaming/sobbing. Then I ran into my husband&#8217;s office and spent some time clinging to his leg, still screaming/sobbing. (Not kidding, you can ask him about the time he sat there looking very bewildered while I waved <em>Finnikin</em> in his face and declared that my life was over.) The original FBF (Facepunched By Feels) book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-Â <em><a title="The Sea of Tranquility" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-sea-of-tranquility/" target="_blank">The Sea of Tranquility</a>.</em> Another book that I pretty read in one sitting because it wasÂ <em>that good</em>, I ended up finishing to read in the middle of the night and couldn&#8217;t fall asleep because of the emotions I still had in me from the book. It took me days to process everything and write my review of it. It&#8217;s a book that I still find myself thinking about all these months later.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>N</strong></span>umber of bookcases you own:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- Officially? Two. Unofficially? Impossible to count. This would be because I tend to pile books on most available surfaces in my house, thus transforming them into impromptu bookshelves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- 3 full bookshelves plus another 4 that are a combo of nicknacks and books&#8230;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>O</strong></span>ne book you have read multiple times:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29127.The_Last_Unicorn" target="_blank"><em>The Last Unicorn</em></a> by Peter S. Beagle. It&#8217;s my go-to book for the times when I need something comforting, magical and heartbreaking all at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-<strong>Â </strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice" target="_blank"><em>Pride &amp; Prejudice</em></a>. You can&#8217;t go wrong with an Austen classic.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">P</span></strong>referred place to read:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- In bed. Especially if it&#8217;s raining or in the middle of winter when I have an actual excuse to use my electric blanket.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- In bed or in the bath.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">Q</span></strong>uote that inspires you/gives you all the feels from a book you&#8217;ve read:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <strong><em>&#8220;Our troubles are but mayflies, rising and falling between the turn of dawn and dusk. And when they are gone to the houses of memory, you and I will remain, Yukiko.&#8221;</em></strong> (From <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/" target="_blank"><em>Stormdancer</em></a> by Jay Kristoff. Excuse me while I go sob into a pillow for a while. And if you&#8217;re wondering why I didn&#8217;t choose anything from the <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em>, it&#8217;s because all my favorites from that series are also massive spoilers.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> -<strong> &#8220;And, when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.&#8221; &#8220;Oneâs Personal Legend is what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. âAt that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives. But, as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to realize their Personal Legendâ¦.whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, itâs because that desire originated in the soul of the universe. Itâs your mission on earth&#8221; -Â </strong></em>Paulo Coelho,Â <i><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/4835472">The Alchemist</a></i></p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">R</span></strong>eading Regret:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- I know I&#8217;m probably supposed to talk about a book I regretted reading, but honestly my biggest bookish regret right now is not being able to re-read old favorites anymore ever since I transitioned to full scale blogging. I just don&#8217;t have the time. I&#8217;m working hard to clear out all my ARCs and library books within 1-2 months so that I can have a break at the end of the year. And then I&#8217;m going on an epic re-reading binge!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>- I don&#8217;t think I really have any&#8230; Like Paola, I&#8217;m definitely still trying to find the balance between re-reading favourites/reading for myself/reading and reviewing for the blog.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;">S</span></strong>eries you started and need to finish (all books are out in the series):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <em>The Seven Realms</em> series by Cinda Williams Chima. Alix and I read the first book, <a title="#2PersonBookClub: The Demon King" href="http://novelideareviews.com/2personbookclub-the-demon-king/" target="_blank"><em>The Demon King</em></a>, as our <a title="#2PersonBookClub: The Demon King" href="http://novelideareviews.com/2personbookclub-the-demon-king/" target="_blank">#2PersonBookClub</a> pick for June and we both fell in love with it. I desperately want to know what happens next, but my perpetual landslide of TBR books keeps getting between me and the second installment! /cries</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-Â <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/57530-divergent" target="_blank">Divergent </a></em>series! Ok so I know it says a series that all the books are out and it&#8217;s done but there isn&#8217;t a series I&#8217;ve stopped reading mi-way through that isn&#8217;t intentional and the last Divergent book is coming out in October so I&#8217;m gonna pretend this counts. It&#8217;s one of my favourite books but I haven&#8217;t read the second book, Insurgent, yet. I think I suffer from a case of having loved the first book so much, I&#8217;m afraid the rest of the series won&#8217;t live up to my expectations.<em><br />

I have the omnibus edition containing all four books. I absolutely love this series and I think it&#8217;s a true testament to the versatility of the author; this is epic high fantasy, which contrasts with her more lighthearted fantasy works such as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle" target="_blank"><em>Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle</em></a> or the <a title="#35: CHARMED LIFE" href="http://novelideareviews.com/35-charmed-life/" target="_blank">Chrestomanci</a> books.

I was thrilled to see it in the Ray Bradbury sale on the Kindle Store a few days ago because I like to re-read every October in time for Halloween.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-Â <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9969571-ready-player-one?ac=1" target="_blank">Ready Player One</a></em>Â by Ernest Cline. I loved this book so much when I read it last year and finally got a copy of it on sale!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #aa2f0c; text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ZZZ</strong></span>-snatcher book (last book that kept you up WAY late):</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Paola</strong> </em>- <a title="The Ocean at the End of the Lane" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane/"><em>The Ocean At the End of the Lane</em></a> by Neil Gaiman, which I read all in one sitting from midnight until 2am. On a weeknight. Because I&#8217;m a wild, reckless human being. And also because this book was extremely good, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Alix</strong> </em>-Â <i>Rush Me</i>Â by Allison Parr! I started reading it in the late evening as a &#8220;relax before bed&#8221; book and ended up reading the whole thing through till 1:20am! Totally worth being exhausted at work the next day!</p>

(Run away now while you can!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: So as avid readers &amp; reviewers, we tend to see a lot of things in books that drive us up the wall. This happens a lot to me while reading YA. Love triangles, Instalove, et al etc&#8230; there are just so many things I end up wishing I could change when Iâm reading a book that has these elements included. I think that this is how a lot of avid readers end up also becoming writers. We have all these smartass ideas for how to fix things, donât we? So letâs fix them! By writing our own!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>TORY</strong></span>: We got this idea from the final exam of Love Triangles 101, where several readers submitted their &#8220;essays&#8221; that ranged from super hilarious (lethal sneezing) to super level headed! Then because I (The Sleeping Latte who is typing this in half-awake state) thought that was a really, awesomely fun idea. Paola suggested a Round Robin Writing event! Some shenanigans went down (oh man, sorry Paola, I&#8217;m laughing at my own autocorrects lol) (<em><strong>Paola</strong>: itâs so awesome lololol</em>) thereafter that resulted in us being here! Now! Because we need you and your input to see if there&#8217;s enough interest in this! :&#8217;D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #960d12;">PAOLA</span></strong>: Basically everyone interested would be invited to group together and get started with some initial worldbuilding. We decided this would be more fun to do together and that way weâre all experts on the world weâve created and how it works. Then, we would start taking turns writing the chapters, one chapter at a time, and each chapter hosted at a different blog. If you wrote the chapter, you would host the story on your blog that day, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3323"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-44eb4eac-6f0d-6842-7e17-2447519ef740" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #960d12;">TORY</span></strong>: Right now, what we need to know is how many of you would be interested in participating in this event! It would probably take a while, as we are likely to give a week for each chapter to be posted. Therefore we are thinking of December as a possible starting month because November is NaNoWriMo so we&#8217;re guessing some of us might be a little busy (in my case, busy whining and ripping my hair out for words ha&#8230;ha&#8230;ha). Also, it&#8217;d be nice to know what kind of story you guys want to write, such as a parody of a genre or an entirely new story!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: But not contemporary because neither Tory nor I is any good at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>TORY</strong></span>: Hahaha yup, unless you want your character killed off :D</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #960d12;"><strong>PAOLA</strong></span>: OR ALL THE CHARACTERS KILLED OFF &gt;:D</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">So anyway, here&#8217;s everything you need to know about our crackpot scheme:</h3>
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;re looking for fellow bloggers/aspiring writers who are interested in collaborating on a story together!</li>
<li>Everyone participating will alternate writing chapters, with each new chapter posting on the writer&#8217;s blog that week.</li>
<li>There will be about a week in between chapters to (hopefully) give enough time for writing.</li>
<li>We&#8217;ll all do the worldbuilding together<span style="color: #000000;">,</span> but the plot will not be outlined. We want to see where it goes!</li>
<li>There will be no minimum/maximum chapter length BUT there will be a chapter limit so that the story eventually ends.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re interested, fill out the form so we can contact you with further details!</li>
</ul>

<p>In case you hadnât noticed, Paola and I are <strong>HUGE</strong> fans of the Wills &amp; Kate aka the Duke &amp; Duchess of Cambridge! OK fine, letâs be honest, weâre huge fans of <em>all</em> royalty period but we have a particular soft spot for the former Kate Middleton. Around here, she is affectionately known as âOur Favourite Duchessâ. How can you not love Mrs Wales? Sheâs kind &amp; down to earth, has wonderful taste in clothing, has the most incredible hair ever and gets to live happily ever after with her prince! *lesigh*</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the upcoming birth of the future heir to the English throne, we have been full of delighted glee, excitedly talking about whether itâs a boy or girl, checking out of photos of Kate looking amazingly stylish as her baby bump grew and debating what names Baby Cambridge would have. Well the wait is finally over! <strong>Welcome to the world Baby Cambridge!</strong></p>
<p>In honour of the birth of Duke &amp; Duchess&#8217; little boy, Paola and I have compiled a list of our all-time favourite royal theme books and movies.<br />
<span id="more-2750"></span></p>
<h3>Alix&#8217;s Picks:</h3>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/princessdiaries.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2755 alignleft" alt="princessdiaries" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/princessdiaries.jpg" width="200" height="315" /></a></p>
<h3><em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/series/43768-the-princess-diaries" target="_blank">The Princess Diaries</a> by Meg Cabot</em></h3>
<p>The Princess Diaries series by Meg Cabot remains to this day my favourite royal themed book (and series!). I adored following Mia through the years from her discovering sheâs the princess heir of a small European country to navigating the waters of what it means to have high expectations placed on you while still trying to be yourself. The series had itâs highs and lows (with 10 books that is to be expected) but throughout the series, Mia remained a relatable, real teenager girl growing into her own, dealing with the realities of school and first loves while also getting to wear amazing tiaras. A must read for everyone!</p>
<h3></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/princessbride.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2760 alignleft" alt="princessbride" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/princessbride.jpg" width="200" height="329" /></a><em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21787.The_Princess_Bride" target="_blank">TheÂ Princess Bride</a> by William Goldman</em></h3>
<p><em>&#8220;As you wish.&#8221;Â </em>I dare anyone to not swoon hearing those words after reading or watching <em>TheÂ PrincessÂ Bride.</em>Â I&#8217;ll admit that I saw the movie,Â <em>numerous time</em>, before ever taking the time to read the book. The book is a wonderful story that calls on your imagination to picture this fantastical world the author has created. I would say it&#8217;s a story that better read as a kid/teen but holds up none the less for adults. The humour,Â wittinessÂ and yes, darkness, of the story is what appealed the most to me. While I adored the book and am very happy I read it, my heart lies with the movie. The movieÂ <em>made</em> the book for me (I think this is one of the rare examples of my liking the movie more then the book). The chemistry between all the characters is insanely good. Everyone is truly perfect in their roles. Oh and did I mention on quotable it is? From &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRgR_mqI-wY" target="_blank"><em>As you wish</em></a>&#8221; to &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3W5GDkgf2w" target="_blank"><em>Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.</em></a>&#8221; without forgetting &#8220;<em>I do not think it means what you think it means</em>&#8221; (how many times do people use this line online without knowing the source!) and &#8220;<em><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhXjcZdk5QQ" target="_blank">INCONCEIVABLE</a>!</em>&#8221; (do yourself a favour and watch the clips of the quotes I linked to!),Â <em>The Princess Bride </em>is anÂ integralÂ part of pop culture. With you have read but the book and haven&#8217;t seen the movie or vice versa, I highly recommend you check it out. Both will delight you and make you laugh and cheer for Princess Buttercut and her Wesley. :)</p>

<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/romanholiday.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2763 alignleft" alt="romanholiday" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/romanholiday.jpg" width="200" height="313" /></a><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0046250/" target="_blank">Roman Holiday (1953)</a></em></h3>
<p>Roman Holiday is one of my all-time favourite movies. Growing up I used to watch classic movies on PBS with my mom and I still remember the first time I saw it. Starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn and set against the gorgeous sceneries of Rome, Roman Holiday tells the story of Hepburn&#8217;s reluctant princess, on tour throughout Europe and miserable at not being able to experience the real world, rebelling against her entourage and discovering Rome with Peckâs American journalist. Roman Holiday show us the other side of what it means to be royal; that your life is not your own and duty must come first. Heartbreaking and heartwarming, this movie is considered a classic for a reason. Audrey Hepburn isÂ marvellousÂ in this and won an Academy Award for her performance.</p>
<h3>Paola&#8217;s Picks:</h3>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ella-enchanted.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2852 alignleft" alt="ella-enchanted" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ella-enchanted.jpg" width="200" height="302" /></a></p>
<h3><em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24337.Ella_Enchanted">Ella Enchanted</a> by Gail Carson Levine</em></h3>
<p>Iâve talked about my love for this book multiple times, but I feel like itâs really worth repeating. No matter how many times I re-read it, I still think itâs amazing; truly one of the best twists on a well-loved, timeless fairytale that youâll find out there. It has all the elements of the original story, but also has a life of its own. Ella remains a favorite heroine of mine, from her determination to break her curse to her commitment to staying true to herself. And letâs not get started on my undying love for Prince Char, because we would be here all day. The man is adorable beyond belief.</p>

<h3><em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6341739-a-brief-history-of-montmaray?ac=1" target="_blank">A Brief History of Montmaray</a>Â by Michelle Cooper</em></h3>
<p>I think most people have a general idea of what to expect from a princess, all of which this book overturns almost immediately. Sophie FitzOsborne, a princess of the obscure island nation of Montmaray, has no throne, no tiara, and no beautiful dresses. She lives in a derelict castle with about ten billion leaks and a shortage of candles. Over the course of three books, her journals recount her familyâs experience throughout the tumultuous years of World War II. The FitzOsbornes are one of my absolute favorite fictional families, it seriously hurt to say goodbye to them at the end of the series. I just wanted to keep following their adventures and misadventures forever. I also have a special place in my heart for Sophie, who has a wry sense of humor and a voice that makes you feel like youâre sitting side by side, chatting with a friend.Â <em><strong>Alix&#8217;s note</strong>: I reallllllly need to read this! Paola has told me so many wonderful things about it! You can <a title="A Brief History of Montmaray" href="http://novelideareviews.com/a-brief-history-of-montmaray/">read Paola&#8217;s full review here</a>!</em></p>

<p>A classic, and a childhood favorite for me. Sarah Crewe, while not an actual member of royalty, has always lived like a princess. Her young father has given her everything she could need or want, although she would much rather be by his side than live in Miss Minchinâs boarding school in London. Sarah is an old soul, compassionate to a fault, but what I love about her is her will and tenacity to survive through the darkest of times. Being a princess is about more than presenting a smiling face to the crowd &#8212; itâs also about providing an example of dignity and perseverance despite adversity, and this book really delivers on that message. And while reading this book as a child, I remember identifying so well with Sarahâs vivid imagination, which she uses as an escape, and as a way to endure.</p>

<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ayoungvictoria.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2849 alignleft" alt="ayoungvictoria" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/ayoungvictoria.jpg" width="200" height="296" /></a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/" target="_blank">Â <em>The Young Victoria (2009)Â </em></a></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0962736/" target="_blank">Â </a>I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH. Iâve seen it about 10 billion times and it NEVER gets old. Itâs beautifully filmed, for starters, with so much lush detail, truly bringing the era to life. I think a lot of people miss out on the fact that there was actually this amazing love story behind Queen Victoriaâs marriage to Prince Albert, and while the movie may embellish here and there on the actual events, I felt like it truly captured the heart of that story. Emily Blunt delivers an iron-willed Victoria in the earliest years of her reign, determined to break free from her motherâs domineering ways and reluctant to give up any measure of independence. Meanwhile, Rupert Friend transcends the word âadorableâ as Prince Albert. I just want to reach into the screen and squish him. Forever. UGH.Â <em><strong>Alix&#8217;s note:</strong> YESSSSSS! I wholeÂ heartedly second ALL of what Paola said!</em></p>

<h3><em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1504320/?ref_=sr_1" target="_blank">The King&#8217;s Speech (2010)</a></em></h3>
<p><em></em>This one goes into the story of King George VI, father of Queen Elizabeth II, and his struggle with the speech impediment that made every public appearance nothing short of terrifying. I loved this one for its unexpected humor and the fact that it featured an unconventional, and yet very strong, friendship. Of course, itâs also inspiring, and I think even more inspiring for me because itâs an example of what a good teacher can bring out in a student, and thatâs something I strive for daily as a teacher myself. Sometimes we have to go to great lengths to reach a student, and this movie shows you the power of making that connection.Â <em><strong>Alix&#8217;s note:</strong> I love this movie too! Obviously Paola has impecable taste if royal theme movies and you should go watch everything she recommends!</em></p>
