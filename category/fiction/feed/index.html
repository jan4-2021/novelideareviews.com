<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Carolyn Jess-Cooke</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fiction/Literature (Adult)</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: August 13, 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC (Netgalley)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a child psychiatrist, Anya Molokova is familiar with the demons that can plague an unstable mind. She even has firsthand experience, having suffered the death of her own daughter from mental illness. But when she meets a small boy named Alex, she takes on the most baffling, disturbing case of her career. For Alex, demons are real. They congregate in the corners of his room, speak to him in broad daylight, and can manifest at any time. He tells Anya that his best friend is one such demon called Ruen, but he doesn&#8217;t tell her that Ruen wants him to do terrible things. Things like hurting other people, and hurting himself. Is Ruen a product of the child&#8217;s psychosis, or something else entirely?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I seldom venture into adult lit these days, but I&#8217;m always interested in books that deal with child psychology because I work with kids on a daily basis. Of course, there was also the possible occult angle, which made me want to read this one even more. <em>The Boy Who Could See Demons</em> was a relatively short read that covered a number of tough subjects &#8212; from the tumultuous history of Northern Ireland to the debilitating effects of mental illness. While at times it had the tendency to sound like an academic paper or someone&#8217;s doctoral dissertation, it also unfolded with excellent pacing that kept me guessing until the very end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2886"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that this book always kept me on uneven footing. I could never completely decide if Alex&#8217;s demons were real or illusion, and I spent the entire book collecting clues. It&#8217;s always refreshing when I can&#8217;t predict what&#8217;s going to happen. All the isolated incidents that come up in Anya&#8217;s investigation are linked, and I could see the pattern, but I really didn&#8217;t have a definitive guess until it was over. (I guessed right, but that conclusion was pretty hard-won.) Alex&#8217;s case combines events and details that are frightening precisely because they could feasibly be related to all the trauma he&#8217;s experienced, BUT you&#8217;re never sure if that&#8217;s the whole reason. There&#8217;s this lingering possibility that it could really be demons, that hell could truly be as accessible as opening a door and finding the room crowded with malicious spirits only he can see. I was afraid for Alex, and increasingly so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alex&#8217;s relationship with Ruen, his 9,000-year-old demonic &#8216;friend&#8217;, was a major focal point of the story for me. Their interactions constantly embodied the idea that good and evil vary greatly based on perspective. Ruen&#8217;s ability to make Alex question preconceived notions of right and wrong were downright scary at times. Even scarier was the fact that all of this could be due to the machinations of Alex&#8217;s mind and not a supernatural entity at all. In the end, which is more frightening? The thought that Alex was being influenced by a demon, or the thought that Ruen&#8217;s influence was entirely the product of his delusions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrative alternates between Anya&#8217;s journal entries and Alex&#8217;s, which I didn&#8217;t mind. What bothered me was that Anya&#8217;s entries often verged on the cold and clinical, reading more like an article in a psychiatry text than the narration of a real person. Her entries also had this annoying tendency to flip back and forth between present and past tense, which was confusing and detracted from the journal entry effect. Another thing that bugged me about Anya&#8217;s side of things was the addition of this weird romantic subplot that I felt was unnecessary. Not only were those parts distracting, they also seemed pretty irrelevant. I wish Anya&#8217;s narrative had focused solely on her investigation of Alex&#8217;s condition and how it affected her without crossing over into a possible romance with his social worker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alex&#8217;s half of the story was told in a more convincing, accessible way. You really get to know him and the nuances of his personality. Much of the plot&#8217;s unpredictability lies in the way Alex tells his experiences, because children are known to tell things the way they see them, and it&#8217;s really unsettling to hear a seven year old talk about the demon whispering in his ear&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a pretty compelling story that invites you to look at good versus evil from a different angle. I spent the whole time trying to piece the puzzle together and wasn&#8217;t able to come up with a solid theory until it was practically over. <em>The Boy Who Could See Demons</em> was short, readable, and did a good job of keeping me guessing. I will say that there is a lot of commentary on Northern Ireland that kind of went over my head since I&#8217;m not very familiar with the history there, so you might want to brush up on facts before you read just to get more out of the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks to Delacorte Press and Netgalley for the ARC!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Samuel Park</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction; Literary Fiction (Adult)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2011, Simon &amp; Schuster; Paperback, 336 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure everyone has come to a place in life where the paths diverge and there&#8217;s no turning back. Often, the biggest decisions we make are the ones we can&#8217;t change our mind about once they&#8217;re made &#8212; or at least, not without considerable grief, not to mention the consequences. Soo-ja, young and impulsive, headstrong and independent, longs for the kind of life her parents resolutely forbid her from living. She has dreams of becoming something more than what they want for her, and when she meets a boy named Min who tells her he can make those dreams come true, she decides to marry him despite her misgivings. Soo-ja is poised on the brink of running full tilt down that path until another man gives her a reason to look back, and to wonder if she made the right choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;What if?&#8221; This is the question that haunts every page of Soo-ja&#8217;s story, which remains one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s a book that lingers long after you put it down. I&#8217;ve since re-read it twice and recently realized that I&#8217;d never reviewed it here on the blog &#8212; a shame, considering how much I love it. Since we&#8217;re in the middle of our <a title="Welcome to Love Triangles 101! + GIVEAWAY!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/welcome-to-love-triangles-101-giveaway/">Love Triangles 101 event</a> right now, it seemed like the perfect time to talk about this book; no, it&#8217;s not YA, but I think those of us who read a lot of YA will find the handling of love triangles in <em>This Burns My Heart</em> to be much more realistic. Being torn between two men involves more than just having to choose Mr. Right. It also means making a choice between one life over another, giving up one world of possibilities that you might never have again. (And hey, if you&#8217;re a big Asian drama fan like me, this book would be the most sophisticated, heart-wrenching K-drama in the universe.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2884"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Chamara, Soo-ja. Chamara,&#8221; said Yul. Chamara. What is the word that comes closest to it? Soo-ja wondered. To stand it, to bear it, to grit your teeth and not cry out? To hold on, to wait until the worst is over? There is no other word for it, no way to translate it. It is not a word. It is a way to console yourself. He is not just telling her to stand the pain, but giving her comfort, the power to do so. Chamara is an incantation, and if she listens to its sound, she believes that she can do it, that she will push through this sadness. And if she is strong about it, she&#8217;ll be rewarded in the end. It is a way of saying, I know, I feel it, too. This burns my heart, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tension and drama between these three characters is woven with so much raw emotion, and yet with such obvious grace. You&#8217;ve probably heard of books that are described as &#8220;achingly beautiful,&#8221; and this is, in my opinion, the definition of that phrase. More often than not, the love triangles we see in YA don&#8217;t really explore how truly painful it really is to be trapped in that situation. It&#8217;s <em>not</em> fun, and when it involves adults, it also involves an entirely new level of heartbreak. Adults have responsibilities and obligations that teens and adolescents don&#8217;t necessarily need to consider. In this case, Soo-ja not only picks the wrong guy, but also marries him. Divorcing this man isn&#8217;t the short, snappy solution you might imagine. She can&#8217;t just extricate herself from the decision she made and start over fresh, not without paying a price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you will want her to do exactly that, especially because the man she really should be with is without a doubt the RIGHT guy in every sense of the word. (I dare you not to love Yul. <em>I just dare you.</em>) And her husband? SO WRONG. But nothing is that simple, and Soo-ja can&#8217;t rewind the clock to change the route she chose. This is the reality she is forced to live with in the aftermath of her wedding and through the years of her marriage to Min, during which Soo-ja goes through a lot of suffering. It doesn&#8217;t help that she continually ends up crossing paths with Yul, and even when their chance encounters are years and years apart, the pain and regret only ever intensify. I was completely caught up in the story &#8212; I seriously could not put it down, and there were so many moments that were so beautiful and yet so unbelievably sad that I often felt like the author was deliberately crushing my heart in his fist. You want a love triangle? This is the real deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about Soo-ja as a heroine is that, even though she made this huge mistake, I still loved her. She pays tenfold for that one momentous choice, but she never lets it break her. Instead, she picks up the pieces and builds herself back up again, better and stronger every time. Sometimes, it requires more strength to stay and endure than to pull away and leave it all behind. It takes even more willpower to keep your head held high, which Soo-ja manages to do, all the while remaining tied to a selfish man and a demoralizing, bitter marriage. She owns up to her mistake, and she faces the consequences, even when doing so is the equivalent of a bitter pill. I admired her and wanted the best for her. I didn&#8217;t envy Soo-ja&#8217;s terrible situation, but couldn&#8217;t help wishing I possessed even the smallest fraction of her willpower. She carries this novel with elegance, even in its darkest moments.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s seriously so hard for me to articulate my love for this novel and the story it tells. I get all tongue-tied when it comes to books like this, books that stay in my heart and never leave it. I couldn&#8217;t recommend it more. <em>This Burns My Heart</em> asks difficult questions about the chances we don&#8217;t take. It&#8217;s a story about the choices we make and what we have to give up in exchange. And it&#8217;s a story of unrequited love, but also the kind of love that stays with you, refusing to let go.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>:Â Ron Irwin</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Literature/Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>:Â Digital ARC, 320 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: June 4th, 2013 (Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin&#8217;s Press)</p>
<p>As a teenager, Rob Carrey was a champion sculler and was offered the opportunity to attended Felton, an elite boarding school with a famous rowing team. Once there, Rob clashes with hisÂ privilegedÂ schoolmates andÂ reluctantlyÂ joins the elite 5 person crew known as the God Four. Now an adult andÂ on a flight home after working on a documentary in South Africa, Rob finds a letter in his mail from an old classmate and crew member talking about their year at Felton and asking Rob to come to their reunion. The letter triggers memories of thatÂ faithfulÂ year which took aÂ tragicÂ turn. C<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">onfronted with his past and realizing just how uncertain his future is, Rob is forced to deal with the trauma of his past and the current turmoil he faces in life.</span></p>
<p>I found the story to be very slow moving. It was clear that the slow placing was intentional and I felt like it made the reader forced to focus more on the characters and their relationships then the mystery of what happened at Felton all those years ago. The language and descriptions were beautiful. I really felt like I could picture Felton and the river as much as Caroline&#8217;s loft. I found that the book did a good job of moving between Rob&#8217;s storyline from the present with that in the past. I enjoyed how it matched the feelings and parelled situations that were going on at both those times in his life. I don&#8217;t know much about rowing but I felt like the book did a good job ofÂ explainingÂ it, not just technically but also the drive that leads people to row and the sacrifices they make to do this sport.<br />
<span id="more-2048"></span><br />
The characters are all very complexed, this felt very much like a character driven novel to me. The story does a great job at slowly revealing and explaining why Rob, Connor, Ruth, Jumbo, Wads and Caroline are all so damaged (because yes, this is a book about very damaged people). I did enjoy how the story slowly revealed what led to these characters being the way they are. The focus of the story was mostly on Rob and Connor at Felton and Rob and Caroline in the present, but I still got a sense of who theÂ surroundingÂ cast was and why.Â You feel the pain of these characters, you understand why they are the way they (even if you don&#8217;t sympathize with them).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story and Rob still weren&#8217;t able to completely draw me in. I was interested but not captivated and ended up at times wishing the story moved more quickly. The story was just too slow for me. I didn&#8217;t mind the dark tone of the novel but that combined with the slow moving story felt too heavy for me. I also had wished that we had been given a little more at the end.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re a fan of character novels that slowlyÂ revealÂ themselves and their story, thenÂ <em>Flat Water TuesdayÂ </em>is a book for you!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to St. Martin&#8217;s PressÂ for making <em>Flat Water Tuesday</em>Â available for review via NetGalley!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Benjamin Wood</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Literature/Fiction (Adult); Mystery</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: May 28, 2013 (Penguin Group)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13069261-the-bellwether-revivals" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>) The Bellwether Revivals<em> opens and closes with bodies. The story of whose bodies and how they come to be spread about an elegant house on the river near Cambridge is told by Oscar, a young, bright working class man who has fallen in love with an upper-class Cambridge student, Iris, and thereby become entangled with a group of close friends, led by Iris&#8217;s charismatic, brilliant, possibly dangerous brother. For Eden Bellwether believes he can heal &#8212; and perhaps more &#8212; through the power of music.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâm not even sure where to begin with <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i>, because itâs impacted me in a really wonderful but simultaneously horrible way thatâs difficult to describe. Writing is like that â youâre trying to describe feelings and you depend a lot on skill but also on luck. Some days youâre more fortunate than others, and you can describe these very complex, subtle emotions and sensations with a few words or many, but always quickly, and without too much thought â it comes naturally, like the feelings themselves. But other days you sit there and think, and think, and think, and nothing comes to you â so you have to sort of awkwardly tough it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâll cheat and quote Bukowski: âFind what you love and let it kill you.â</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2009"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything in this book stuck out to me, from the characterization to the tone, everything. But the base of characterization and tone is the writing itself, isnât it? I went into <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i> with a bar set up very, very high, because Iâd read the introduction and oh, the author has a BFA in creative writing, and now he lectures in creative writing at the University of London. I expected a lot! And what did Wood do? He flew the bar to Pluto and asked me was I even trying? The prose is simply done without being simplistic, and the descriptions are lovely and detailed without being the sort of drag that youâd expect from, say, Morgensternâs original <i>Princess Bride</i> manuscript. Wood describes Cambridge so beautifully, with a foot both in romance and in reality, so much that I almost want to call that Cambridge a dream. Itâs like brewing tea â steep it too long and it gets bitter, donât steep it long enough and all you have is water. Wood has it perfectly, crisp and with substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dialogue is also top-notch. Itâs witty, itâs believable, which is something that Iâve really started to look for when Iâm reading. Much of the time the dialogue is so contrived I have to wonder if the authorâs ever had an actual conversation before. I canât help it. I cringe. But I knew I had a keeper when I started reading the dialogue out loud, with an accent and all the trimmings; I couldnât get through a single one without feeling the compulsion to act it out, and that hasnât really happened since Harry Potter. The characters are so lively and natural that I could not only relate to them, but I could find them in my friends and family. Wood does an excellent job of making Oscar, the protagonist (though looking back, I see this more as a technicality), incredibly ordinary, even if heâs anything but â heâs a closet intellectual who skipped college to work at a nursing home. Surrounded by people named Eden and Iris and Yin, though, and BMWs and Saabs and Alfa Romeos, houses with actual atriums and rectories, the Auvergne, telesurgery and NPD, he is just so â¦ <i>mundane</i>. Almost trivial at times, in the scheme of things? Insignificant. But his humanity amidst all of these supernatural people possessed by their studies, or their siblings â heâs the grounding of the novel. Heâs so terribly alive and it gives the novel so much depth I could drown in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concerning the storyline, I wonât say much, only that the foreshadowing is utterly masterful and that thereâs no defense against it â itâll ruin you. This review is my final draft, but in my first Iâd initially said that, âIf you like being held by the hand, not too tightly, just enough, and led into a maze by someone who knows the way (and you trust them, but you still feel a little niggling doubt in the back of your head), then this is for youâ; Iâd like to reword that now. If you like being held by the hand, just tightly enough to give you some comfort, and led into a maze by someone you know knows the way, then this is not the book for you. You cannot let get of the hand, and even if you could, that hand will not let go of you. The further you go into the book the more you feel that the situation is spiraling out of control, that you are well on your way to the exit but so much <i>awful</i> is happening, maybe it would be better to turn back and go to the start! But like life, there is only ever one direction you can go in â that hand has good intentions but it grips you like a vice, because you canât relive the past, you canât change the past, you have only the present, terrifying, and the future, full of <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope â thatâs a very large theme in the book. Wood covers it in its complexity, both sides of the spectrum, and although you will think he is kind for providing you with something to cling onto in times of trouble, you will this is more an act of cruelty than anything. Iâd written half of this review before Iâd finished the book â Iâd gotten around page two hundred and although the tension was beginning to build up and the introduction all but spoils you for the ending, my glasses were still rose-colored and I believed that everything would come neatly unknotted in the end. It didnât occur to me that this was a Gordian knot, and that the only way out is by the sword.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">â29 PAGES LEFT IâM ALMOST TOO UPSET TO CONTINUEâ â a frenzied message to my sister, Paola, over Facebook chat. But continue I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Â </b>Romance, heavy psychology (but not too much that itâll overwhelm you if youâre a layman in the area), a convoluted storyline that lets you stand flat on your feet and then <i>rips</i> the ground from underneath you â not to mention the technical aspects, perfect imagery and delicious, well-thought diction and syntax â itâs some of the finest storytelling Iâve ever had the pleasure and the misery of being a part of (even if small), and I donât put that lightly. I was legitimately hurt by this book, like Benjamin Wood lied to and used me and then left me out with the waste, and thatâs why I have to give it five stars. As much as it ruined me, I could never regret having read it; itâs monumental, a thriller, and if this is only Woodâs debutâs novel then I donât know what Iâll do when he publishes more. Buy them, probably.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you Penguin Group &amp; NetGalley for providing us with an ARC of this book!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Courtney Angela Brkic</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Literature/Fiction (Adult)</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley, 273 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: May 28, 2013 (Little, Brown &amp; Company)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anything that centers around the bond between sisters always resonates pretty deeply with me because I have a sister of my own. We&#8217;re seven years apart, but look and act more like twins now that we&#8217;re not kids anymore. (Actually, you might have seen her around here &#8212; her name is Nina and she does guest reviews for us once in a while.) The heart of this book is the relationship between sisters Magdalena and Jadranka, who have stuck together through the turbulent events of their shared childhood and, while as different as night and day, have a connection that&#8217;s never been broken. Until the day Jadranka disappears, and Magdalena finds herself assaulted by a storm of family secrets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from being about a pair of sisters, <em>The First Rule of Swimming</em> has an extremely nuanced writing style that brings its characters to life. Magdalena&#8217;s grandfather, grandmother, and overseas relatives were fully fleshed out. The big snag for me, though, was the pacing. As lovely as the writing can be at times, the fact remains that this isn&#8217;t a book for those who love a lot of action. Action isn&#8217;t even a big deal to me, and yet the pace still felt agonizingly slow at times. It was one of those books that were under 300 pages and yet still took me forever to get through. This story definitely calls for a patient reader.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2004"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved the way the two sisters balanced one another; they truly know each other inside out. It made my heart hurt reading the things they&#8217;d been through together and how fiercely Magdalena fought to protect Jadranka, who was younger. But it was equally powerful to see how Jadranka, the one everyone assumed was wild and careless, actually saw more about the world than she let on. She was as much Magdalena&#8217;s keeper as Magdalena was hers. In the realm of complex relationships, this book undeniably succeeds. It really delves into the reasons why family will always be family, peeling back layer after layer of shared history.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing worth mentioning is that Rosmarina Island, where most of the book takes place, is so vivid and well drawn that it serves as a character unto itself. You can see the island in your mind&#8217;s eye, and being able to visualize it only makes it easier to understand why it&#8217;s so important to the intertwined lives in the novel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve already said that the pace bothered me, largely because it felt like not very much happened at all in the first half of the book. The groundwork for all the different family members and their relationships with one another was established, yes, but I think another big reason why it seemed slow was that a vital part of the story is the violent history of what is now the Republic of Croatia, where the fictional island of Rosmarina is located. I am definitely not the world&#8217;s expert on Croatia, and the book doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of information. You just get dropped into the events surrounding Croatia&#8217;s battle for independence from Yugoslavia, events that directly affected Magdalena and Jadranka&#8217;s family. Lack of familiarity with this subject matter made it pretty confusing for me and I had to stop and read up on that situation before proceeding. If I hadn&#8217;t, I would have missed out on a pretty significant slice of the plot. You can only rely on context for so long before it just doesn&#8217;t work anymore. I feel like just a pinch of background info on Croatian independence would&#8217;ve done wonders for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had issues with certain events that took place towards the end of the book, but thankfully the ending itself redeemed the story in my eyes and brought it full circle. It was a satisfying ending and one that was infused with so much hope. I appreciate when loose ends are tied up at the conclusion of a story, I guess because the raging control freak in me just really wants to know what happened to everyone and where they ended up after the plot wound down. It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t live with endings that are more ambiguous, but for this particular book and its characters, I was glad to have closure. I felt like the ending helped lighten the burden of reading all those pages at such a sluggish pace.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The First Rule of Swimming</em> evokes such a wide range of emotions. It truly explores the depths of loyalty and sacrifice, exposing the ties that bind Magdalena and Jadranka to one another as well as those that bind them to three generations of a family separated by war and circumstance. While a very slow read that demands a lot of endurance, I thought it was thought provoking as well. It&#8217;s a book that renews your faith in what family really means and where home will always be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Little, Brown &amp; Company and NetGalley for the ARC! The book is out May 28th!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHORS</strong>: Suzanne Hayes &amp; Loretta Nyhan</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: May 28, 2013 (Harlequin)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In January 1943, Glory Whitehall takes a deep breath and writes a letter to a woman who lives miles away. That woman is Rita Vincenzo, forty one years old and praying that her husband and son will stay safe wherever they are in the war-torn world. Despite how different they are, the two women forge a bond through pen and paper that ultimately withstands pain, tragedy, and tumultuous change. They become lifelines for one another in a time of great uncertainty. Rita sends wisdom and advice tempered by years of being a wife and mother, while Glory relates the constant learning experience of marrying young and trying to raise two small children while their father fights at the front lines in Europe. Together, far apart and yet side by side, they wait for the war to end and fight to keep faith alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I usually find myself liking books told through letters. I think it&#8217;s an especially good medium for historical fiction; it works like a charm for <a title="#4: The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society" href="http://novelideareviews.com/4-the-guernsey-literary-potato-peel-pie-society/" target="_blank"><em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em></a>, for example, and that&#8217;s one of my favorite reads (and re-reads) ever. There&#8217;s something about letters back and forth that makes a story so much more personal. It&#8217;s a quality that I think is becoming steadily overwhelmed in a world where snail mail isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s primary method of communication any more. But I&#8217;ve had pen pals my entire life, and finding a letter in the mailbox is still a lot like Christmas for me. That&#8217;s why it was easy for me to appreciate the easy warmth of the friendship between Rita and Glory, and although it lacked the magic of <em>Guernsey</em>, I still found it to be an enjoyable read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1860"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best things about this story being told in letters is the fact that the book itself was actually also <em>written</em> through letters. The authors are long distance friends and pen pals who decided to write something together, and it all began with one letter written in character. This letter prompted a response, and so on, until the whole story just unfolded. As of the interview in the last few pages of the ARC, the authors had never met in person. For me, this explained why the letters between Rita and Glory felt so authentic; they really were letters, and they have the feel of being an extended conversation back and forth. Layers of the two women&#8217;s separate lives are peeled back a little more with every opened envelope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved that the authors mentioned that this book is very much about waiting. Both Rita and Glory are wives left on the home front while their husbands are shipped out to fight a war, and they both feel more than a little bit isolated as a result. There are many differences between them &#8212; Rita is old enough to be Glory&#8217;s mother; Glory is the mother of two young children while Rita has a grown son also fighting overseas; Rita is pragmatic and fairly set in her ways, while Glory is young and impressionable. Even so, I liked their unconventional friendship. I also really liked Rita as a character. I loved that she was outspoken and wise, that she was so keen to dispense advice but willing to learn new things at the same time. She had a strong personality and neither denied it or feared it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Um&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t like Glory. I wanted to. I really hoped she would grow on me as the story went on, and that she would grow into herself, but by the time the book ended I was still pretty frustrated with her. I was well and truly <em>annoyed</em>. She makes some crazy stupid decisions, and I don&#8217;t really like to excuse them with the fact that she&#8217;s young because I feel like that kind of insults all the rest of us who are young as well. Being young doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s okay for you to follow through on ridiculous, hurtful choices. I thought she was selfish and flighty and I hated the little love triangle she created for herself because all along, it was clear to me that she could have stopped all the drama from happening. It frustrated me that Glory constantly bemoaned what an idiot she was being and yet DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. She makes some very selfish, ultimately damaging choices and I began to suspect that she just really liked the drama too much to let it go and live a peaceful life. (Sorry, I&#8217;m being vague on purpose because I don&#8217;t want to spoil the story! Suffice it to say that Glory ticked me off throughout.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, I liked it very much and I walked away from it with a good feeling. Mostly because of Rita, and because Rita&#8217;s story in particular was so satisfying. Rita is the character that probably needs the least amount of development &#8212; Glory needs development in spades &#8212; and yet it&#8217;s Rita who seemed to grow the most by the end of the story. I chose to focus on her because Glory was making me absolutely cross-eyed with fury. The only other character who pissed me off as much was Levi, and that was also directly related to her.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I&#8217;ll Be Seeing You</em> was a bit predictable, but thankfully populated with characters that were fleshed out and felt real. Again, being told in letters really added depth and dimension. Because it&#8217;s set during WWII, I found myself holding my breath while turning the pages, just waiting for a telegram bringing bad news or a letter confirming the worst. There were many moments that were truly heartwarming and illustrated the power of friendship to pull you through pain, sorrow, and regret. I&#8217;d still recommend <em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Societ</em>y over this one, but it&#8217;s a quick, light read that is both hopeful and optimistic. If you have a best friend, it will make you want to run over and hug her, wherever she might be. If you don&#8217;t have a best friend, you&#8217;ll ache to have one. Personally, it made me want to write a letter. (Alix also happens to be my pen pal as well as my co-blogger so WATCH OUT ALIX! Hahaha)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Harlequin and NetGalley for the review copy!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>:Â Jennifer Echols</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: New Adult, Paranormal</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: ARC ebook, 310 Pages</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHER</strong>: Pocket Star</p>
<p>As teenagers, Holly and Elijah didnât just have their mutual attraction in common; they also suffered âepisodesâ during which they believed they had supernatural abilities and were diagnosed with MAD (Mental Adolescence Dysfunction). Both were informed they would be on medication for their mental disorder for the rest of their lives and more importantly told to stay away from each other. Now in their early 20s, Holly finds herself crossing paths once again with Elijah. They discover that they have both been diagnosed with MAD and that their supply of medication has been cut off. Elijah kidnaps Holly and takes her to where their medication is made. During their trip, Holly discovers not only that Elijah can read minds but she can in fact levitate objects (which she had been made to believe were MAD associated hallucinations) and that everything that she had been told since her âepisodeâ was a lie. On a mission to confront those who have lied to them, Holly and Elijah end up discovering a much larger and far reaching conspiracy then they realized.</p>
<p>Iâm a fan of Jennifer Echols&#8217; other novels and was excited to pick up this book especially since itâs classified as âNew Adultâ. I thought the premise was intriguing! People with supernatural abilities hiding plain sigh in Vegas casino? Star-crossed lovers finding their way back to each other? Conspiracies? Levitators, mind readers, mind controllers and more? Yes please! But unfortunately the book didnât end up working for me. It had all the right pieces but it just didnât come together. I found the story incredibly disjointed and slow. I never connected with the characters and had trouble understanding their motivations.</p>
<p>I felt like the story tried to incorporate too many elements: Holly and Elijahâs pasts, their romance, their parentâs past, the Casino, the Rez, the on-going battle with the Rez and more! All of these elements on their own were interesting in theory but inÂ executionÂ I felt like they were either too quickly addressed in a unclear manner. I still donât understand why the Rez wanted to control the Casino, exactly what was Isaacâs motivations and his history with Kaylee. To me the story spent too much time in the Rockies on Elijah and Hollyâs quest to find their medication. This is not a long book and a lot of time was spent on describing and addressing, what felt like to me, things that were small and mundane. On the flip side, once they got back to Las Vegas, the story sped up and suddenly I felt like too much was happening and important elements were being revealed and quickly dismissed or explained in a vague and unsatisfying manner. The climax of the story had Holly going back and forth so much (I wonât say more to avoid spoilers) that I completely lost track of where she stood and it left me feeling confused and unsatisfied by the resolution. I was left with more questions at the end of the book then I had at the start. Everything was too nicely tied up only then to be suddenly left on a cliffhanger (and as far s I know this book isnât part of a intended series).</p>
<p><span id="more-1764"></span>Holly and Elijahâs connection and âepicâ romance was not convincing to me. Sure they had crushes on each other as teenagers but now suddenly as adults, they fall in love in a day essentially. Holly starts thinking lustful thoughts for Elijah pretty much from the time they see other again and Elijah can hear her (which felt creepy to me) and somehow that becomes the basis for their relationship? It felt like Elijah was using his abilities to read Holly&#8217;s mind to insure she would fall and stay with him. Â I did like how Holly called him out on that. I do believe that they have a connection, that was clearly established, but I had a hard time with their relationship beyond that of two people who care (but not love) each other by the end of the book.</p>
<p>I didnât feel like Holly nor Elijah were fleshed out characters. They remained very two-dimensional and I couldnât related to them as a result. I did enjoy Kaylee (Hollyâs roommate) a lot. I felt that I could understand her actions a lot more and enjoyed her the more for it. I also really like Shane (Elijahâs roommate). Even though he isnât seen much in the book, I thought he made and impact and I would gladly read a book about him and Kaylee!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 1.5/5</h2>
<p>This book really wasn&#8217;t for me. Too many factors in the story and characters never came together for me and made it impossible for me to enjoy it. I found that this was unfortunately a case of excellent premise and lack luster execution.</p>
<p>Thank you to Pocket Star and NetGalley for making this book available to me for review!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Peggy Riley</p>

<p><strong>RELEASE DATE:</strong> April 16th 2013, Little, Brown and Company</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A mother and her daughters drive for days without sleep until they crash their car in rural Oklahoma. The mother, Amaranth, is desperate to get away from someone she&#8217;s convinced will follow them wherever they go&#8211;her husband. The girls, Amity and Sorrow, can&#8217;t imagine what the world holds outside their father&#8217;s polygamous compound. Rescue comes in the unlikely form of Bradley, a farmer grieving the loss of his wife.&#8221;</i> (taken from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790893-amity-sorrow" target="_blank">Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I picked up this book because I found the subject matter â a mother running away from a fundamentalist cult with her daughters â new and interesting. The first couple of chapters were intriguing and left me wanting to read further to learn more about Amaranth and her daughters, Amity and Sorrow, and their experiences in the cult. Unfortunately, my interest in the book started to dwindle after those initial chapters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book is beautifully written. Author Peggy Riley has a way with words and was able to paint a day and desolate world in a beautiful way. I enjoyed how her descriptions were enough to set the scene but also allowed the reader to fill in with their imagination and own interpretations. That being said, the narrative is very choppy; it keeps jumping between the present and various moments in the past. It also jumps between Amaranthâs narration and Amityâs. At times, I was left feeling confused as to whether these events were happening in the present or in the past. Certain events were left hanging because of these time jumps, which led to even more confusion for me. This was the weakest point of the book for me and made it less enjoyable than I expected it would be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also felt very disconnected from the characters, especially Sorrow. The disjointed nature of the narrative resulted in none of the characters being fully developed. I enjoyed reading how Amaranth ended up marrying and helping to found the cult, but I was left wanting to understand her more. Amityâs character was underdeveloped as well. I enjoyed her voice and found that it was interesting to see her struggle with wanting to keep peace between her mother and Sorrow yet also struggle with jealousy toward her sister.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weakest character for me was Sorrow. I thought she was fascinating on the surface; she was the only one of the three whose faith in the cultâs beliefs never really wavered but she also remained a very superficial character. Her over-the-top actions ended up turning her into the clichÃ©d characterization of a âgirl in a cultâ for me. Still the relationship and dynamic between the mother and daughters as well as with the new people who enter their lives was interesting. Riley created fascinating characters and story for these people, I just wish sheâd delved further into it.</p>
<p><span id="more-1651"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amity &amp; Sorrow, while being a relatively short read in terms of page numbers, is by no means an easy read. The subject matter is intense and at times very disturbing. Readers with triggers for abuse: please be careful while reading this book, as abuse is a common theme throughout.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you NetGalley and Little, Brown &amp; Company for the chance to read and review this book!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Erin Morgenstern</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 387 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Is magic born and bred? Or can it be trained, disciplined through logic? This question lies at the heart of a mysterious circus, its black and white tents serving as the stark background to a duel between two schools of thought. It is a duel that has taken place before, the game played on a different field and with different pawns. On one side is Celia, the daughter of a famed master illusionist, whose talent and abilities are as natural to her as breathing. On the other side is Marco, the ward of a mysterious man who teaches him that magic belongs to anyone and can be mastered with diligence. Each is told that they are bound to another: a rival, an opponent, whose identity they will not be told. The winner is determined by the wonders he or she can create. The game will not end until that winner is chosen. Thus, the night circus is born. It becomes something more than a mere gathering of tents and performers, as Celia and Marco begin a battle that spans years. It is a war waged in secret, interwoven with the crisp autumn air and the sound of applause. Each move brings something new and unexpected: mirrored halls that reflect scenes from somewhere else, rooms containing entire deserts, a carousel that seems to live and breathe. Even more unexpected is the love that takes root between two people who are tied to one another by a rivalry that ultimately separates them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You guys. I can&#8217;t talk about this book. I love it with an intensity that can&#8217;t be expressed in words. I mean, that&#8217;s pretty obvious considering how melodramatic I get just trying to type out a few sentences. That summary up there? Nearly drained all the energy I have. Writing about <em>The Night Circus</em> makes my heart ache. Yes, it was a very popular book when it released and the hype was out of this world. Please, don&#8217;t let anything you&#8217;ve heard get between you and this book. You&#8217;ll miss out on something enchanting and rare.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1605"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I finished reading, I was so enthralled that it felt impossible to return to my own life. This is the magic of <em>The Night Circus</em>. The writing is beautiful, the circus itself rendered in such detail. Even the love story, which could so easily have ruined everything, instead makes the magic grow brighter. I&#8217;m not talking a sappy, <em>Twilight</em>-esque love story full of unrealistic expectations and sentiments. Celia and Marco have no idea that the other is their rival until over halfway through the book. They have minimal contact with each other even when the circus begins, and yet they fall in love through a series of subtleties. They get to know each other through the things they create, their relationship founded on wonder. It gradually becomes clear to both that this love is real and not illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are so few books out there that can rival <em>The Night Circus</em> when it comes to atmosphere. The imagery is so vivid, crisp and clear, that there were many times I felt sure I could just close my eyes and fall right into the pages, emerging somewhere else entirely. The book takes command of all five senses. Perhaps the simplest way to describe this sensation is to tell you that the circus will become reality. You&#8217;ll want to be there. And in a lot of ways, you&#8217;ll feel as though you already are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My only issue with the plot was the ending. It left me a little bit disoriented, and I wasn&#8217;t a fan of how Celia and Marco&#8217;s story was resolved. I think it&#8217;s possible that a re-read would help set things straight for me, because in my experience it&#8217;s always so hard not to freak out in the last chapter in my rush to find out what happened.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dark, thrilling, Victorian, romantic, complex &#8212; I simply could not ask for more from this book. This may sound stupid, but it really is a magical experience, everything perfectly timed and everything fitting together exactly the way you feel it should. It draws you in, takes you to another world, and you won&#8217;t want to leave. In short, it&#8217;s got everything a good book should. HIGHLY recommended.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Lauren Graham</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fiction/Chick Lit</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC, 352 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE:</strong> April 30th 2013, Ballantine Books</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Franny Banks gave herself 3 years to make it in New York as an actress. Itâs now 6 months before her deadline and sheâs nowhere near having âmade it.â With that deadline looming over her, Franny starts doubting herself â until unexpected turns and encounters lead her down a path of discovery and revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I, just like many others, picked up this book because I am a fan of Lauren Graham (star of <em>Gilmore Girls</em> and <em>Parenthood</em>). I was hesitant, worrying that this book might disappoint and be another case of actors thinking they are writers. Fortunately, Someday, Someday, Maybe is a well written, smart, and funny book that didnât disappoint after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dialogue has the same kind of fast paced, snarky witticism that Graham has become famous for delivering on-screen. I think she infused a lot of herself and what was probably her own personal experience as an up-and-coming actress into the character of Franny. I liked the surrounding cast of characters, although I wish we had spent more time learning more about them. Both Jane (Frannyâs best friend) and Dan (their roommate) were interesting characters but I was left wanting more background. We do get more insight into Dan, but Jane remains a superficial, peripheral character. I thought the story was a fairly realistic portrayal of what itâs like to be a struggling actress. Franny struggles both financially and emotionally throughout and it never feels overdone for the sake of either pitying her or playing up the clichÃ©s of being a âwaitress/actress.â The overall story was smart, heartwarming and funny, but predictable. Nothing happens in the storyâs development that came to me as a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That being said, it was written well enough that I still enjoyed seeing Franny go through the experience. My favourite twist happened in the end, and it was the only part of the story I actually wasnât able to predict. The book ends on a fairly abrupt note that can be interpreted as ambiguous. Personally, I found the ending to be very appropriate and it gave me closure on this chapter of Frannyâs life. I can, however, see how some readers might be left wanting more, especially since 2 key points of the story arenât clearly concluded.</p>
<p><span id="more-1549"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite features of the book was the inclusion of some pages of Frannyâs Filofax and various call sheets and script pages. It made me feel more connected to her. My biggest issue: the book is written in first person narrative. I find that this writing style makes it harder for me to get a sense of the full story because you are âstuckâ in the brain of your lead character.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are a fan of Lauren Graham or looking for a good, easy, yet touching read, I think this book is for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you NetGalley and Ballantine Books for the chance to read and review this book before release!</p>
