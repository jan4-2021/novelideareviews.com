<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Elizabeth Wein</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 9/10/2013, Disney Hyperion; Digital ARC, 370 pages</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p><strong>RELATED READ</strong>: <a title="Code Name Verity" href="http://novelideareviews.com/code-name-verity/" target="_blank"><em>Code Name Verity</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rose Justice is the youngest member of a small group of female pilots ferrying planes for the Alliance during the fall of 1944. Fresh from a happy, somewhat sheltered life in Pennsylvania, she finds herself caught up in the war &#8212; its many tragedies, but also its many inspiring reminders that hope continues to exist even when everything seems to be in ruins. This is something that Rose learns and holds on to when she is caught by the enemy during an unplanned landing in Germany and shipped off to a concentration camp. In Ravensbruck, she learns to withstand cruelty in all its forms, relying on the human capacity to love rather than its capacity to hate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t ask me how I&#8217;m managing to sit at my desk and actually type full sentences right now. At the rate September is going, I&#8217;m going to be a total train wreck by the time October comes around. Not only are there so many new releases this month (and late last month; ahem, <a title="Crown of Midnight" href="http://novelideareviews.com/crown-of-midnight/"><em>Crown of Midnight</em></a>), but quite a few are also loaded with the kind of high-intensity feels that leave you in a state of shock afterward. They&#8217;re good books &#8212; <em>really, really good books</em> &#8212; but I swear I feel like I&#8217;ve been beaten black and blue with all this emotional reading material! This is definitely the case with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262236-rose-under-fire" target="_blank"><em>Rose Under Fire</em></a>, a title I already expected to break my heart. After all, that&#8217;s exactly what happened with its predecessor, <a title="Code Name Verity" href="http://novelideareviews.com/code-name-verity/" target="_blank"><em>Code Name Verity</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3308"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As some of you may know, <em>Code Name Verity</em> is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. This is a book that was the equivalent of a massive sucker punch to the feels, for me. I thought it was cleverly written, and the friendship between its two characters was both inspiring and heartbreaking. So when I started reading Rose Under Fire, I was bracing myself for all of this to happen again. I knew that the protagonist of this book would be spending most of the story as a concentration camp prisoner, so I was prepared for that &#8212; although of course her experience was still jarring to read about. What I didn&#8217;t expect was for Rose&#8217;s story to be connected to Verity&#8217;s. I loved seeing Maddie and Jamie here, and every time Julie was mentioned I swear I was always this close to just sobbing my face off. I thought this was a completely separate story, and I was ok with that, but it felt really good to see characters from <em>Code Name Verity</em> anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was really, really, REALLY hard not to compare <em>Rose</em> to <em>Verity, </em>especially because of how much I love the first book. I will say that this one keeps the fire burning, as Rose endures six months at Ravensbruck that change her forever, but never succeed in killing her spirit. She finds hope and deep friendship that sustain her through the freezing nights and gnawing hunger &#8212; a sisterhood of girls and women who fight back against their oppressors in any way they can. Together, they brave unbelievable cruelty and overcome their differences. It&#8217;s a powerful example of women working together rather than taking each other down, and you know I&#8217;m always a firm supporter of that. Something I loved about <em>Verity</em> was the way nothing could keep its characters down, even faced with the most unspeakable horrors. They were human, and they could bleed and be broken, but there was this light inside them that never went out. The same goes for Rose and her fellow prisoners, who pull together to become a family in a place where it seems all love and joy are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you weren&#8217;t a fan of <em>Verity</em>&#8216;s unconventional writing style, you may like <em>Rose</em> better. It&#8217;s a much more straightforward read, although still told mostly in flashbacks through letters and Rose&#8217;s journal entries. Alix liked Verity as well (just not as much as I did) but had a problem with the big POV switch between the two main characters a little over halfway in, which actually unsettled me as well. This doesn&#8217;t happen here, since we are with Rose throughout the entire story. The narrative still revolves quite a bit around planes and flying, which is a bit confusing at times when you have no knowledge of the subject. Rose is a pilot, so this makes sense, but if you&#8217;re like me and are NOT a pilot at all, it might be kind of distracting to hear about it so much. Another thing &#8212; and I hate to gripe about this, but I&#8217;m gonna be honest &#8212; is that I really didn&#8217;t like Rose&#8217;s attempts at poetry in the beginning of the book. Later on, though, there were some poems that actually made my heart ache. One in particular got highlighted to death and then copied into my quotes notebook, if that says anything at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I want to address before I finish up this review is that I&#8217;ve seen some complaints out there about how Elizabeth Wein wrote a book about concentration camps but didn&#8217;t really mention Jews. I see why this is might be bothersome to others, but I didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with it. Jews were not the only victims of Hitler&#8217;s regime. I think it&#8217;s a good thing that the author chose to highlight the experiences of other groups during WWII as well, because I feel like those are often overlooked. For future generations to truly understand the darkness of that time in history, we need to look at it from all sides, and not just from one perspective. Rose&#8217;s adopted sisters in Ravensbruck told her to tell the world. I feel like we need to tell the world every story we can, stories of hope and survival, regardless of barriers like race and religion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Rose Under Fire</em> didn&#8217;t have the same impact on me that <em>Code Name Verity</em> did, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I disliked it. It&#8217;s a different kind of story; while Verity always made me feel like everything was balanced precariously on the edge of a knife, Rose felt like an invisible force holding me up. It doesn&#8217;t make your heart race with danger, but it makes your heart ache with both sorrow and unshakeable hope. Overall, I think hope is the message of both books, and I highly recommend both. They&#8217;re unforgettable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Disney Book Group for providing me with an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review! Rose Under Fire hits bookstores everywhere on September 10th &#8212; DON&#8217;T MISS IT!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Elizabeth Ross</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Delacorte BFYR; Hardcover, 336 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maud Pichon is destitute and in need of a means to support herself in the glittering metropolis of Paris. When she answers an ad posted by the Durandeau Agency, she isn&#8217;t shocked to find out that her new employer is in the business of selling ways to enhance beauty; after all, beauty is a prime Parisian commodity. What does shock her is the fact that the agency&#8217;s aim is to enhance beauty by contrasting it with ugliness. Plain girls like Maud are hired out to clients in need of a foil &#8212; someone whose unremarkable appearance will make their own best qualities look even better by comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were several factors that made <em>Belle Epoque</em> unique for me &#8212; things that helped it stand out from the piles and piles of new YA releases this summer. I can&#8217;t help but appreciate the ways in which this book pleasantly surprised me. Set against a vividly realized late-1800&#8242;s Paris (during the eponymous &#8220;beautiful era&#8221;), Maud&#8217;s story calls to question the meaning of beauty, but also the power of friendship to bring people together despite the differences between them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3010"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is kind of sad, but I read so much YA these days that I&#8217;ve started to become just a wee bit paranoid. When I start a new book, every last one of my bookish senses is in overdrive, trying to sniff out potential love triangles and other such horrible YA pitfalls. I&#8217;m happy to say that my paranoia proved unfounded here. A love triangle might have been possible, but never came to be. And the plot was wide open for the author to maneuver us all into a sickening mess of too much romance and too little substance. Maud is a vulnerable, impressionable character from the very first page who was at high risk for falling into all of the typical traps authors like to set for their YA heroines. But you know what? This time, there were no traps to spring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mother Nature is not democratic. Look at the orchid compared with the dandelion: one exotic and rare, the other a common weed&#8230; And so with beauty. Some have an advantage, some a cross to bear. Some just fade into the background, forever plain and obscure &#8212; invisible, inconsequential.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such is the role of a <em>repoussoir</em>, and when Maud Pichon finds herself in this unusual line of employment, it&#8217;s a difficult and humiliating position indeed. The main purpose of a <em>repoussoir</em> is to <em>repel</em>. They are hired by rich women and girls so that their ugliness will make the client&#8217;s beauty shine twice as bright. It&#8217;s the kind of job that leaves your self esteem in tatters on the floor, and Maud has enough problems as it is. She ran away from her tiny village and domineering father, arriving in Paris with nothing to her name. She has no choice but to work, and this is the work she&#8217;s found. Honestly, I felt pretty terrible for Maud in the beginning. I can&#8217;t even imagine having to take up this profession. While she wasn&#8217;t the kind of heroine that immediately snagged my attention, the spark in her eventually caught fire and I ended up identifying with her determination to be independent. But she was definitely a flawed character, and I don&#8217;t think I would have liked her if not for her friendship with Isabelle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unlikely friendships always make me happy. I love it when two people from completely different backgrounds, with all the odds against them, still manage to connect with one another in a meaningful way. When Maud is hired by the wealthy, beautiful and ambitious Countess to serve as her debutante daughter&#8217;s foil during the Season, I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect. Isabelle was cold and a bit stereotypically rebellious to start out with, while Maud was this blank slate that I had only the most shallow impressions of. But when they&#8217;re together, Maud and Isabelle really came through as characters. Each girl&#8217;s personality peeled back in layers, and I was so glad to see that there was more to them than what I saw on the surface. Maud was originally hired to reflect Isabelle&#8217;s light and make her even more alluring, but actually it became an even exchange. Maud set a part of Isabelle free, so that she could be her true self. In turn, Isabelle helped Maud realize what she wanted to be and who she was. Their friendship went deeper than appearances and societal expectations. I really loved that the book focused on these two girls and the bond they shared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to say, though, that there was this stretch of storyline that just infuriated me to the point that it affected my enjoyment of the book. To put it plainly, there&#8217;s a point when Maud morphs into this complete and utter douchebag and all I wanted to do was deck her one for good measure. I mean, she was TERRIBLE. I absolutely loathed her and I hated what happened to her character during those chapters. My opinion of her took such a drastic downturn that I actually cheered when it all came back to bite her in the ass. You&#8217;re probably not supposed to cheer when the protagonist suffers for her mistakes, but boy did Maud deserve it. And I kind of felt like she recovered from it all too easily, in the end. I wanted more lasting consequences. (I sound just like a strict schoolteacher right now hahaha.) I&#8217;m not saying I didn&#8217;t want a happy ending, but I really felt like Maud&#8217;s actions and general awfulness deserved heavier consequences. I realize that this had to happen for character development&#8230; and yet it still bugged me. Not to the point that I severely downrated the book or anything, because that would&#8217;ve been unfair of me, but enough that my enthusiasm dimmed a bit.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Belle Epoque</em> explores the implications of beauty and the many ways in which someone can be beautiful &#8212; or the opposite. It was refreshing to read a YA novel that didn&#8217;t constantly inundate me with sappy romantic conflicts and shallow characters. In fact, this is a book where friendship takes precedence over romance, and it&#8217;s even more admirable because it features a positive, supportive friendship between two girls who discover that they have more in common than anyone might have guessed. It&#8217;s a book with a lot of commentary on how much in life is based on, and affected by, appearances. The historical setting is brilliantly rendered, and while Maud was not my favorite protagonist ever, her friendship with Isabelle made up for it. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a YA read that defies expectations.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Teri Brown</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction/Paranormal</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Balzer + Bray; Hardcover, 373 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anna Van Housen yearns for stability &#8212; for something more than just the illusion of a stable life. After spending most of her childhood living a nomadic existence, she&#8217;s privately thrilled that her mother has secured a potentially permanent gig for them in New York. Marguerite, a self-proclaimed medium, will be performing stage shows and seances to earn their keep, with Anna assisting. But even her mother&#8217;s incredible showmanship pales in comparison to Anna&#8217;s natural gifts, which begin to haunt her with disturbing visions and premonitions almost as soon as they arrive in the city. Danger seems to wait at every turn, and it&#8217;s up to Anna to decipher which threats are real and which are only illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, this was a case where the synopsis ended up being more exciting than the actual plot. I enjoyed the 1920&#8242;s setting (very reminiscent of Libba Bray&#8217;s <a title="The Diviners" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-diviners/"><em>The Diviners</em></a>, although perhaps less detailed) and couldn&#8217;t help being intrigued by Anna&#8217;s unorthodox job as an illusionist, but never felt like I got the suspense I was promised. While still a fairly enjoyable read, <em>Born of Illusion</em> fell short of my expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2885"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To elaborate on that statement, I have to point out that my notes for this book contain a lot of complaints that nothing is really happening. I mean, it seemed like things were happening, sure. Some seances go wrong, with Anna&#8217;s abilities going haywire and making it difficult for her to hide them. She finds herself being chased down alleyways by shadowy figures. She keeps having terrible nightmares of her mother in danger. <del>She becomes embroiled in an exasperating love triangle.</del> These are all things that make you feel like the plot is moving, when really it isn&#8217;t. Mostly, Anna suspects that something bad is about to happen and sets about trying to uncover it before it&#8217;s too late. It&#8217;s less suspenseful and more of an ongoing discourse on Anna&#8217;s private suspicions, which she rehashes over and over again in her head, punctuated by brief action here and there that truthfully felt like it was over before it even began. For some reason, the characters are blind to all the myriad clues littered all over the place. If you&#8217;re looking for a harrowing mystery, look elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s made very clear from the beginning that Anna&#8217;s mysterious father is supposedly the legendary Harry Houdini, which I think was the point where I started to feel a prickle of irritation. This is probably going to sound weird, but it actually annoys me when real historical figures are incorporated into fictional events. It always comes off as presumptuous to me, not to mention risky, because it&#8217;s so hard to get it right. In this case, the whole Houdini connection might have been bearable, even logical, if Anna and every other person in the book didn&#8217;t spend all their time mentioning it. A substantial portion of Anna&#8217;s internal conflict revolves around the identity of her father; she&#8217;s always wondered about him and whether her mother was telling the truth, but at the same time she&#8217;s developed an extreme dislike for having her own skills compared to that of Houdini. She doesn&#8217;t want her entire identity to hinge around possibly being his illegitimate child, which her mother has used as both a marketing ploy and as a way to rationalize Anna&#8217;s talent as a magician. I get it, I do. But EVERYBODY talks about this throughout the story and I was almost as sick of it as Anna, who already spends a lot of time contemplating it in her inner monologue without having it frequently discussed in dialogue as well. Again, I GET IT. I DO. STOP TALKING ABOUT IT NOW. Argh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Probably the most compelling thing going on here is Anna&#8217;s difficult, complicated relationship with her mother, Marguerite Van Housen, who has issues with sharing the spotlight. Anna&#8217;s always lived in Marguerite&#8217;s shadow, yearning for her approval and secretly harboring fears that one day her mother will leave her behind. She has so much admiration for Marguerite, but also a lot of insecurities because of their relationship. There&#8217;s also the fact that Marguerite is a fraud and Anna is the real thing &#8212; she can sense the feelings of others and sometimes catches glimpses of the future through visions and prophetic dreams, while her mother&#8217;s &#8216;gifts&#8217; are just a very well-constructed act. They&#8217;re both very strong personalities in different ways and share a love for performing, but Anna starts longing for more of the spotlight and Marguerite refuses to be upstaged. The tension between mother and daughter is executed just right, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a highly anticipated read for me, and certainly not a terrible one, but not anywhere near what I was expecting. It was definitely the kind of situation where I spent a lot of time tapping my foot impatiently as I waited for everyone in the story to finally catch up and figure out what was going on. I was disappointed to find that <em>Born of Illusion</em> didn&#8217;t deliver on the suspense and mystery it promised. That being said, it does an amazing job bringing the glittering 1920&#8242;s to life without overwhelming you with intense detail, and Anna&#8217;s world of stage lights and sleight of hand is certainly intriguing.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Samuel Park</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction; Literary Fiction (Adult)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2011, Simon &amp; Schuster; Paperback, 336 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure everyone has come to a place in life where the paths diverge and there&#8217;s no turning back. Often, the biggest decisions we make are the ones we can&#8217;t change our mind about once they&#8217;re made &#8212; or at least, not without considerable grief, not to mention the consequences. Soo-ja, young and impulsive, headstrong and independent, longs for the kind of life her parents resolutely forbid her from living. She has dreams of becoming something more than what they want for her, and when she meets a boy named Min who tells her he can make those dreams come true, she decides to marry him despite her misgivings. Soo-ja is poised on the brink of running full tilt down that path until another man gives her a reason to look back, and to wonder if she made the right choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;What if?&#8221; This is the question that haunts every page of Soo-ja&#8217;s story, which remains one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking I&#8217;ve ever read. It&#8217;s a book that lingers long after you put it down. I&#8217;ve since re-read it twice and recently realized that I&#8217;d never reviewed it here on the blog &#8212; a shame, considering how much I love it. Since we&#8217;re in the middle of our <a title="Welcome to Love Triangles 101! + GIVEAWAY!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/welcome-to-love-triangles-101-giveaway/">Love Triangles 101 event</a> right now, it seemed like the perfect time to talk about this book; no, it&#8217;s not YA, but I think those of us who read a lot of YA will find the handling of love triangles in <em>This Burns My Heart</em> to be much more realistic. Being torn between two men involves more than just having to choose Mr. Right. It also means making a choice between one life over another, giving up one world of possibilities that you might never have again. (And hey, if you&#8217;re a big Asian drama fan like me, this book would be the most sophisticated, heart-wrenching K-drama in the universe.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2884"></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Chamara, Soo-ja. Chamara,&#8221; said Yul. Chamara. What is the word that comes closest to it? Soo-ja wondered. To stand it, to bear it, to grit your teeth and not cry out? To hold on, to wait until the worst is over? There is no other word for it, no way to translate it. It is not a word. It is a way to console yourself. He is not just telling her to stand the pain, but giving her comfort, the power to do so. Chamara is an incantation, and if she listens to its sound, she believes that she can do it, that she will push through this sadness. And if she is strong about it, she&#8217;ll be rewarded in the end. It is a way of saying, I know, I feel it, too. This burns my heart, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tension and drama between these three characters is woven with so much raw emotion, and yet with such obvious grace. You&#8217;ve probably heard of books that are described as &#8220;achingly beautiful,&#8221; and this is, in my opinion, the definition of that phrase. More often than not, the love triangles we see in YA don&#8217;t really explore how truly painful it really is to be trapped in that situation. It&#8217;s <em>not</em> fun, and when it involves adults, it also involves an entirely new level of heartbreak. Adults have responsibilities and obligations that teens and adolescents don&#8217;t necessarily need to consider. In this case, Soo-ja not only picks the wrong guy, but also marries him. Divorcing this man isn&#8217;t the short, snappy solution you might imagine. She can&#8217;t just extricate herself from the decision she made and start over fresh, not without paying a price.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, you will want her to do exactly that, especially because the man she really should be with is without a doubt the RIGHT guy in every sense of the word. (I dare you not to love Yul. <em>I just dare you.</em>) And her husband? SO WRONG. But nothing is that simple, and Soo-ja can&#8217;t rewind the clock to change the route she chose. This is the reality she is forced to live with in the aftermath of her wedding and through the years of her marriage to Min, during which Soo-ja goes through a lot of suffering. It doesn&#8217;t help that she continually ends up crossing paths with Yul, and even when their chance encounters are years and years apart, the pain and regret only ever intensify. I was completely caught up in the story &#8212; I seriously could not put it down, and there were so many moments that were so beautiful and yet so unbelievably sad that I often felt like the author was deliberately crushing my heart in his fist. You want a love triangle? This is the real deal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about Soo-ja as a heroine is that, even though she made this huge mistake, I still loved her. She pays tenfold for that one momentous choice, but she never lets it break her. Instead, she picks up the pieces and builds herself back up again, better and stronger every time. Sometimes, it requires more strength to stay and endure than to pull away and leave it all behind. It takes even more willpower to keep your head held high, which Soo-ja manages to do, all the while remaining tied to a selfish man and a demoralizing, bitter marriage. She owns up to her mistake, and she faces the consequences, even when doing so is the equivalent of a bitter pill. I admired her and wanted the best for her. I didn&#8217;t envy Soo-ja&#8217;s terrible situation, but couldn&#8217;t help wishing I possessed even the smallest fraction of her willpower. She carries this novel with elegance, even in its darkest moments.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s seriously so hard for me to articulate my love for this novel and the story it tells. I get all tongue-tied when it comes to books like this, books that stay in my heart and never leave it. I couldn&#8217;t recommend it more. <em>This Burns My Heart</em> asks difficult questions about the chances we don&#8217;t take. It&#8217;s a story about the choices we make and what we have to give up in exchange. And it&#8217;s a story of unrequited love, but also the kind of love that stays with you, refusing to let go.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Susan Dennard</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical/Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, HarperTeen; eBook, 248 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleanor Fitt thought her family&#8217;s situation couldn&#8217;t get worse. Since her father&#8217;s death, money has been increasingly scarce, and now Eleanor&#8217;s brother has gone missing, with the only clue to his whereabouts appearing in the form of a letter crushed in the fist of an undead corpse. To make things worse, her mother unwittingly invited a malicious spirit into their home, she&#8217;s falling hard for an inventor of ill repute, and corsets make it extremely difficult to outmaneuver the undead horde. Land sakes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve heard so much about this series that picking it up was inevitable. I confess to knowing pretty much nothing about it when I requested from the library &#8212; only that it was mostly well received and had something to do with the undead. Guys, you don&#8217;t need very much convincing when it comes to this girl and a good zombie apocalypse. It&#8217;s a really interesting concept because there are, in my opinion, so many different ways to handle it. <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> brings the undead masses to 1876 Philadelphia, and while it was frequently predictable, I still thought it was a fun ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2814"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps that the heroine is easy to get along with. Eleanor Fitt is under a lot of pressure to help undo their formerly affluent family&#8217;s fall from grace. All she has to do is make a good match &#8212; which is easier said than done, because Eleanor happens to feel very strongly about being an independent woman during a time when girls and women were expected to remain resolutely in the background. It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, and Eleanor is having none of it. She has an insatiable mind, always brimming with curiosity, which of course gets her into twenty different kinds of trouble on a daily basis. It&#8217;s always nice to see a heroine who gets herself into scrapes but manages to get herself out of them, whether this means using her head or finding the nearest available baseball bat and taking out zombies with it. I liked Eleanor&#8217;s inquisitive nature and her determination to be something more than what society expected of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also thought it was interesting that there were so many mentions of body image. Early on in the story, Eleanor&#8217;s late father is quoted as having listed &#8216;a fondness for buttered toast&#8217; as one of her few vices. A lady is supposed to appear dainty and eat like a bird, plus there&#8217;s the problem of fitting into an extremely tight corset, so Eleanor is frequently hungry or even regretting taking an extra bite of breakfast. Her mother criticizes her figure, and Eleanor seems plenty aware that she isn&#8217;t the ideal size, but I appreciated that the concept was even included. I feel like it&#8217;s overlooked in other books of this genre; yes, the descriptions of beautiful dresses and tiny waists abound, but what about the problems associated with cultivating that image? To me, Eleanor was more down to earth because she struggled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the plot was predictable (I was able to guess most of the twists early on, as well as the big reveal), I didn&#8217;t feel especially bothered by it. First of all, I was intrigued by the concept of a zombie horde in the middle of 1876 Philadelphia and enjoyed the inclusion of the Centennial Exhibition as a central part of the story. The steampunk &amp; &#8216;scientific&#8217; paranormal bits were often a bit much and I ended up taking them with a grain of salt, but the author did a great job clearly defining the setting without overwhelming the reader with excessive period detail. It was sort of like&#8230; okay, I don&#8217;t really see how you could really rig an alarm to go off when the undead are near, BUT that&#8217;s fine because the characters are fun and the pacing keeps me from getting bored. (Kind of like those episodes of Ghost Adventures when they hold up some bogus piece of electromagnetic equipment and I just roll my eyes&#8230;) There&#8217;s a lot of action, with the first chapter opening with an undead attack, and there aren&#8217;t any dull moments acting as filler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, I liked Daniel immensely, but he totally punched me in the face with that ending. I mean, I don&#8217;t believe it for a second, but props to the author for choosing that moment in particular to NOT be predictable at all.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An incredibly readable book, <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> is an enjoyable excursion into an alternate Philadelphia where the dead aren&#8217;t always truly dead. A sassy heroine and a colorful supporting cast make the predictability more bearable. I&#8217;m happy to report that the conclusion of book one definitely has me excited for book two, although I can&#8217;t divulge much more than that without risking spoilers for you all. I&#8217;d say this one is one the lighter end when it comes to zombie books &#8212; if you&#8217;re looking for something really dark and full of feels, try <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8051458-the-reapers-are-the-angels" target="_blank"><em>The Reapers Are the Angels</em></a> by Alden Bell, or <a title="Warm Bodies" href="http://novelideareviews.com/warm-bodies/" target="_blank"><em>Warm Bodies</em></a> by Isaac Marion (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7619057-warm-bodies" target="_blank">book</a> AND <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588173/" target="_blank">movie</a>) for unexpected warmth and humor!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jessica Brockmole</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: July 9, 2013, Ballantine Books; Digital ARC, 168 pages</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: ARC via Netgalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elspeth Dunn has lived on the Isle of Skye her entire life, never mustering the courage to cross the channel and chase her dreams. Instead, she writes poetry &#8212; poetry that makes its way across the sea to a young American named David Graham who reads her words and, spellbound, decides to send her the very first piece of fan mail she&#8217;s ever received. What begins is a friendship that deepens into love over time, over the course of years and despite thousands of miles. But then Elspeth and Davey are separated by war and circumstance, their story left unfinished. It isn&#8217;t until decades later, armed with only one stray letter and a lifetime of questions, that Elspeth&#8217;s daughter Margaret finally discovers the truth behind her mother&#8217;s past.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love war novels. I just do. I can&#8217;t explain it, really, except to say that my late grandmother was a teenager during WWII and used to tell me story after story of her family&#8217;s experiences during those times. They were dark days, to be sure, but I guess my grandmother&#8217;s memories sparked my interest in the era from a very young age. So, I didn&#8217;t have an issue with this book because it&#8217;s a war novel. In fact, that&#8217;s why I requested the ARC in the first place. And I didn&#8217;t mind that it was in epistolary format, since I actually like when stories are told through letters, for the most part. One of my absolute favorite books of all time is <a title="#4: The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society" href="http://novelideareviews.com/4-the-guernsey-literary-potato-peel-pie-society/"><em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em></a>, for example, and it&#8217;s pretty much the epitome of epistolary war novels out there, in my opinion. (Wow, what a highly specific category hahaha) I think this must be one reason why I ended up not really being impressed with <em>Letters From Skye</em> &#8212; it ended up being really drab compared to <em>Guernsey</em>, and I never felt invested in any of the characters. I just couldn&#8217;t connect with Elspeth and Davey at all, even though I certainly tried.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2625"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From the beginning, I felt unable to envision these characters as real. There was always something off about the letters themselves, which didn&#8217;t feel at all like they were written in the early 1900s. The tone was anachronistic, with word choices that seemed like they didn&#8217;t belong in the time period. I liked Elspeth and Davey&#8217;s relationship when they were friends, because they had some funny exchanges during that time and I thought it was nice for two people to strike up this correspondence when they were from such different backgrounds and in such different places in life. Elspeth was a bit mysterious (it wasn&#8217;t hard to guess what her secret was), while Davey sounded very boyish and much more immature than she was. This was okay, because their personalities were complimentary. But then the friendship became a romance, and I often felt super awkward once that started. So many moments that should have been touching turned out feeling contrived instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I just didn&#8217;t like them as a couple. Which was rough, because not liking Elspeth and Davey as a couple and consequently finding yourself not really caring if they end up together or not makes reading this book extremely difficult. There was also the not so small matter of why the two couldn&#8217;t be together, but that&#8217;s a huge spoiler that I can&#8217;t discuss here. Suffice it to say that I didn&#8217;t like that aspect of their story either. Oddly enough, I was more interested in Margaret&#8217;s chapters, set in WWII, as she sets off on this quest to figure out where her mother has disappeared to and what secrets she&#8217;s been hiding all these years. Maybe I liked these chapters because they weren&#8217;t crammed with Elspeth and Davey&#8217;s letters to one another, which really started to feel redundant by the time I got halfway through.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about writing a story entirely through letters is that those letters have to be amazing. They have to carry the story and yet seem like realistic correspondence at the same time. What worked for <em>Guernsey</em> was its warmth and humor, both of which are missing from this book. Even the most mundane things &#8212; walking along the hills, cleaning your house, chasing a goat &#8212; are absolutely hilarious and/or strangely charming in that book. But with <em>Letters From Skye</em>, I mostly felt bored. The mundane things really were mundane. And all of the romantic pronouncements between Elspeth and Davey came off as too much. I didn&#8217;t feel a connection at all. Of course, authentic letters would include all the essentially boring day-to-day occurrences in life, and I expected that. What I didn&#8217;t expect was a love story with no spark to it at all. At least, not for me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a decent book, and not necessarily a waste of time or anything that extreme, but I didn&#8217;t find it very compelling. I had no attachment whatsoever to the main characters and felt very little sympathy for their plight, and despite all these letters traded back and forth for YEARS, I still felt like I didn&#8217;t really settle into their world or the atmosphere of the time period. If you want an epistolary novel set in WWII that is heartwarming, hilarious, and memorable, then I highly recommend you skip this one in favor of <a href="www.goodreads.com/book/show/2728527-the-guernsey-literary-and-potato-peel-pie-society" target="_blank"><em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em></a>. (Though, if you haven&#8217;t read <em>Guernsey</em> yet, you might have a better experience with this one than I did since you wouldn&#8217;t be comparing the two&#8230;) You could also try <a title="Iâll Be Seeing You" href="http://novelideareviews.com/ill-be-seeing-you/"><em>I&#8217;ll Be Seeing You</em></a>, set in WWII as well but featuring correspondence between two women who become unlikely friends through their letters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Many thanks to Ballantine Books and Netgalley for the ARC!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They steal from the rich to give to the poor, but not all of Robin Hood&#8217;s merry men are what they seem. Scarlet, for one, isn&#8217;t even a man. She&#8217;s a young woman dressed as a boy, and none of the boys can keep up with her &#8212; except one, and that&#8217;s the fabled Robin himself. Scarlet would do anything, commit any crime, if it meant bringing justice to oppressed, overtaxed Nottinghamshire. Masquerading as Will Scarlet, she lies, cheats, steals and breaks innocent prisoners out of the sheriff&#8217;s jail. But Scarlet is also running away from the guilt and trauma of her past, and no disguise could ever be enough to evade the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been a long while since I last read a Robin Hood retelling (<a title="#41: THE OUTLAWS OF SHERWOOD" href="http://novelideareviews.com/41-the-outlaws-of-sherwood/"><em>The Outlaws of Sherwood</em></a> by Robin McKinley, specifically) and I&#8217;ve never read the original, but I&#8217;ve always enjoyed the premise and was familiar with the main characters so I was interested to see what kind of twist <em>Scarlet</em> would bring to the timeless story. Guys, I was <em>not</em> disappointed! I just really love strong female leads in books for so many reasons, and the titular character here is as tough as they come. While there was a minor adjustment period for me when it came to the narrative style, I ended up rather impressed by how the author used Scarlet&#8217;s way of talking in such a strategic way. I thought this book was an incredible take on Robin Hood with all the adventure, daring deeds, and romance a girl could wish for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1941"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I tend to talk about the main character first when writing a review because the MC can make or break a book for me, and I know a lot of other readers are the same way. In this case, Scarlet herself was a big reason why I loved this retelling as much as I did. She has a tough exterior but a heart of gold. I appreciated that she was also flawed &#8212; Scarlet hoards her secrets and has such a difficult time learning to trust even those she calls comrades that it often causes friction. But I admire her because she&#8217;s a survivor, because of her inherent compassion, and for the fact that she remains true to who she really is even while spending most of her time hiding behind a disguise. Also, I just can&#8217;t help but love a girl who knows the right moment to give up negotiations and just punch someone in the face. (It&#8217;s an art, what can I say?)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many readers will no doubt struggle at first to get used to Scarlet&#8217;s way of speaking, which isn&#8217;t always pretty or even grammatically correct. I went with it and assumed for most of the book that it was just a stylistic choice made by the author&#8230; but later realized that it was also a really clever way to symbolize Scarlet&#8217;s adoption of a new identity as well as how far she was willing to go in order to escape the person she used to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps the most surprising element of Scarlet for me was just how much I loved the romance. And by romance, I don&#8217;t mean the not-really-a-love-triangle that was going on, because to me there was never really any competition between Corner A and Corner B. You pretty much know that there&#8217;s only one man for Scarlet. (I MEAN COME ON.) But that relationship is complicated by Scarlet&#8217;s secrets, which threaten to undermine the entire thing more than once. It&#8217;s an exercise not only in learning to love and trust someone else, but also to love and trust herself. Anyway, I think this book does a great job proving that &#8216;romance&#8217; doesn&#8217;t have to be hot and heavy to qualify as romantic. I really loved that aspect. Plus it doesn&#8217;t hurt that my corner of the love triangle totally won in the end~ #NotBiasedAtAll</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Um, but back to that not-really-a-love-triangle&#8230; actually it really annoyed me. Specifically, the other man vying for Scarlet&#8217;s affections drove me up the wall. I didn&#8217;t find him charming or even mildly amusing AT ALL. He came off rather pushy and invasive, not to mention shallow, and I hated how long Scarlet put up with him. I guess I just didn&#8217;t mesh with that character in particular because not once in the entire story did I stop disliking him. So, I ended up taking off a star because that part of the book didn&#8217;t sit well with me and it was another case where I felt like a love triangle wasn&#8217;t necessary, even though this one wasn&#8217;t anywhere near as aggravating as others I&#8217;ve read, nor as predominant in the plot. Thankfully. Because, ugh.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Scarlet</em> brings a new, refreshing perspective on the age-old tale of Robin Hood. You just really have to love and respect a retelling that incorporates a fierce, passionate, independent woman into a story that&#8217;s always been geared towards a male audience. I recommend this book to anyone looking for great YA historical fiction, and to anyone who often finds themselves longing for a heroine they can admire.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHORS</strong>: Suzanne Hayes &amp; Loretta Nyhan</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: May 28, 2013 (Harlequin)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In January 1943, Glory Whitehall takes a deep breath and writes a letter to a woman who lives miles away. That woman is Rita Vincenzo, forty one years old and praying that her husband and son will stay safe wherever they are in the war-torn world. Despite how different they are, the two women forge a bond through pen and paper that ultimately withstands pain, tragedy, and tumultuous change. They become lifelines for one another in a time of great uncertainty. Rita sends wisdom and advice tempered by years of being a wife and mother, while Glory relates the constant learning experience of marrying young and trying to raise two small children while their father fights at the front lines in Europe. Together, far apart and yet side by side, they wait for the war to end and fight to keep faith alive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I usually find myself liking books told through letters. I think it&#8217;s an especially good medium for historical fiction; it works like a charm for <a title="#4: The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society" href="http://novelideareviews.com/4-the-guernsey-literary-potato-peel-pie-society/" target="_blank"><em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Society</em></a>, for example, and that&#8217;s one of my favorite reads (and re-reads) ever. There&#8217;s something about letters back and forth that makes a story so much more personal. It&#8217;s a quality that I think is becoming steadily overwhelmed in a world where snail mail isn&#8217;t anyone&#8217;s primary method of communication any more. But I&#8217;ve had pen pals my entire life, and finding a letter in the mailbox is still a lot like Christmas for me. That&#8217;s why it was easy for me to appreciate the easy warmth of the friendship between Rita and Glory, and although it lacked the magic of <em>Guernsey</em>, I still found it to be an enjoyable read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1860"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best things about this story being told in letters is the fact that the book itself was actually also <em>written</em> through letters. The authors are long distance friends and pen pals who decided to write something together, and it all began with one letter written in character. This letter prompted a response, and so on, until the whole story just unfolded. As of the interview in the last few pages of the ARC, the authors had never met in person. For me, this explained why the letters between Rita and Glory felt so authentic; they really were letters, and they have the feel of being an extended conversation back and forth. Layers of the two women&#8217;s separate lives are peeled back a little more with every opened envelope.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I loved that the authors mentioned that this book is very much about waiting. Both Rita and Glory are wives left on the home front while their husbands are shipped out to fight a war, and they both feel more than a little bit isolated as a result. There are many differences between them &#8212; Rita is old enough to be Glory&#8217;s mother; Glory is the mother of two young children while Rita has a grown son also fighting overseas; Rita is pragmatic and fairly set in her ways, while Glory is young and impressionable. Even so, I liked their unconventional friendship. I also really liked Rita as a character. I loved that she was outspoken and wise, that she was so keen to dispense advice but willing to learn new things at the same time. She had a strong personality and neither denied it or feared it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Um&#8230; but I didn&#8217;t like Glory. I wanted to. I really hoped she would grow on me as the story went on, and that she would grow into herself, but by the time the book ended I was still pretty frustrated with her. I was well and truly <em>annoyed</em>. She makes some crazy stupid decisions, and I don&#8217;t really like to excuse them with the fact that she&#8217;s young because I feel like that kind of insults all the rest of us who are young as well. Being young doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s okay for you to follow through on ridiculous, hurtful choices. I thought she was selfish and flighty and I hated the little love triangle she created for herself because all along, it was clear to me that she could have stopped all the drama from happening. It frustrated me that Glory constantly bemoaned what an idiot she was being and yet DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. She makes some very selfish, ultimately damaging choices and I began to suspect that she just really liked the drama too much to let it go and live a peaceful life. (Sorry, I&#8217;m being vague on purpose because I don&#8217;t want to spoil the story! Suffice it to say that Glory ticked me off throughout.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, I liked it very much and I walked away from it with a good feeling. Mostly because of Rita, and because Rita&#8217;s story in particular was so satisfying. Rita is the character that probably needs the least amount of development &#8212; Glory needs development in spades &#8212; and yet it&#8217;s Rita who seemed to grow the most by the end of the story. I chose to focus on her because Glory was making me absolutely cross-eyed with fury. The only other character who pissed me off as much was Levi, and that was also directly related to her.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I&#8217;ll Be Seeing You</em> was a bit predictable, but thankfully populated with characters that were fleshed out and felt real. Again, being told in letters really added depth and dimension. Because it&#8217;s set during WWII, I found myself holding my breath while turning the pages, just waiting for a telegram bringing bad news or a letter confirming the worst. There were many moments that were truly heartwarming and illustrated the power of friendship to pull you through pain, sorrow, and regret. I&#8217;d still recommend <em>The Guernsey Literary &amp; Potato Peel Pie Societ</em>y over this one, but it&#8217;s a quick, light read that is both hopeful and optimistic. If you have a best friend, it will make you want to run over and hug her, wherever she might be. If you don&#8217;t have a best friend, you&#8217;ll ache to have one. Personally, it made me want to write a letter. (Alix also happens to be my pen pal as well as my co-blogger so WATCH OUT ALIX! Hahaha)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Harlequin and NetGalley for the review copy!</p>

<p><strong>SERIES</strong>: <em>Strands of Bronze &amp; Gold</em>, #1</p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jane Nickerson</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 297 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still mourning the loss of her beloved father, Sophia Petheram is surprised to receive a letter from her godfather &#8212; a letter inviting her to travel to his sprawling Mississippi estate and stay with him as his ward. Bordering on destitute now that their father and his income are gone, Sophia and her siblings come to the conclusion that she will accept the invitation and thereby have hope for a better future. She will be taken care of, her every need attended to; in short, she will be gain financial security, something the family has never been able to enjoy. And in the beginning, Sophia does indeed enjoy living at majestic Wyndriven Abbey, lavished with expensive gifts and a new, exceedingly privileged lifestyle. But as time passes, and as the affectionate attentions of her handsome godfather gradually intensify, it becomes clear that Sophia&#8217;s beautiful surroundings are nothing but a gilded cage. What terrible secrets lie in wait behind locked doors?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This&#8230; was not a pleasant experience for me. To be honest, it was a total train wreck and I have this vague theory that I stayed on board for the entire thing out of grotesque fascination. Either that, or it was the undying optimist in me that kept hoping something would happen to redeem this book before it was too late. Sadly, this was not to be. <em>Strands of Bronze and Gold</em> was extremely problematic for me, from the decidedly useless non-heroine to the disturbing lack of plot. I was drawn to the prospect of a Southern Gothic retelling of Bluebeard, but this one definitely didn&#8217;t deliver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1689"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We first meet Sophia Petheram, newly orphaned and the youngest of four siblings, while she&#8217;s sitting in a coach and en route to her godfather&#8217;s fabulous mansion in Mississippi. She has been corresponding with this man, the very wealthy Bernard de Cressac, since she was only a child. We are treated to many mentions of lavish gifts that were sent to her throughout this lengthy correspondence, as well as a very clear understanding that Sophia adores her godfather despite the fact that she&#8217;s never actually met him. Does she adore him because seems to be a good, kind, wonderful individual? Sort of. Mostly it seemed to me like she loved his material wealth and receiving gifts. It bugged me from the start that she comes from a family that never had much money, was the recipient of all these amazing gifts from her godfather, and yet never seemed to show remorse or regret that her siblings got jack shit in comparison. So, from the beginning, Sophia and I were not on good footing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My distaste for her only intensified. She&#8217;s deliberately written as a naive, innocent character and I can understand that. I know why it was done, but I don&#8217;t think it was done well at all. Instead of appearing to be merely naive, Sophia came across as utterly vapid. We spend the first quarter of the book listening to her go into rapturous descriptions of her godfather&#8217;s opulent mansion, the many shiny new possessions she acquired upon arriving to live with him as his ward, minute details of dresses and camisoles and corset laces, and COMPLETELY missing the fact that aforementioned godfather is creepy as all hell. I get that she&#8217;s supposed to be innocent and therefore should be excused from realizing that a man who has her dress up in skimpy foreign costumes for dinner because &#8220;it pleases him&#8221; is super creepy beyond belief, but I thought she&#8217;d get clued in to this faster than she did. Instead, she&#8217;s actually enthralled by the weird amount of attention he gives her, and even when she starts to get disillusioned with his possessiveness, she STILL volleys back and forth between, &#8220;OMG! I think I&#8217;m in love with my godfather!&#8221; and &#8220;OMG! I think my godfather is a bipolar serial killer!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; I mean, how do you come to the conclusion that your godfather is possibly a bipolar serial killer but then change your mind and think, oh, maybe I&#8217;m just being melodramatic, actually he&#8217;s really really nice?? This just boggles the mind, people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m dead serious about this. It takes Sophia about 3/4 of the book to really start to loathe the man, and even then she&#8217;s STILL entertaining thoughts of rehabilitating him, maybe influencing him for the better and using her &#8216;feminine wiles&#8217; (snort) to make Creepy Godfather behave himself. I rolled my eyes so often at her inner monologue that at one point I really thought they&#8217;d stay permanently rolled back into my skull. She&#8217;s seen all kinds of proof that he&#8217;s despicable, crazy, controlling, manipulative&#8230; but because she&#8217;s your classic Mary Sue with an exaggerated do-gooder personality (excuse me while I gag), she never develops the strength to escape from him, nor even the true desire to do so. Sophia is neither clever nor resourceful. Clues are EVERYWHERE, but she rides right past them on her pony (another gift from Creepy Godfather). It really disgusted me that she went on accepting his gifts and enjoying being spoiled at the price of remaining in this abusive relationship. I know others may see her as a character who starts off naive and becomes stronger and wiser, but I beg to differ. She blunders her way through the plot and somehow, by complete accident, manages to free herself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book addresses slavery, but mostly by trying to portray Sophia as the Abolitionist Fairy. She&#8217;s not a very effective abolitionist. (If you ask me, she&#8217;s not very effective at anything.) She cares about the slaves on de Cressac&#8217;s plantation and tries to make friends with them, help them, etc but her dedication to them is lukewarm at best. It was disturbing how quickly she could be distracted from wanting to improve conditions for the slaves &#8212; literally all de Cressac had to do was dangle some new jewelry in front of her and she&#8217;d go galloping back to him like a small child offered candy. Anyway, I think <a href="http://thebooksmugglers.com/2013/03/book-review-strands-of-bronze-and-gold-by-jane-nickerson.html" target="_blank">this review</a> best sums up the problematic portrayal of slaves and slavery in <em>Strands of Bronze and Gold</em>. I&#8217;m afraid this will turn into a 10 page essay if I get started on this subject. UGH.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 1.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought this book was burdened by a shallow, essentially useless protagonist. I just can&#8217;t bring myself to like or enjoy a novel when I can&#8217;t respect the main character. It also didn&#8217;t help that a whole lot of nothing occurs during most of the story; all the big reveals pretty much take place within the last 20 pages. I remember being halfway through it, pausing, and wondering why nothing had really happened yet. Then things got really, really bizarre &#8212; things like Sophia embroidering tapestries with human hair &#8212; and I just. I don&#8217;t know. I DON&#8217;T KNOW, YOU GUYS. (I think Sophia may have just edged <a title="The Madmanâs Daughter" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-madmans-daughter/">Juliet Moreau</a> out of her spot as my least favorite MC of the year&#8230; that, at least, is a feat.)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Martine Leavitt</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy/Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 216 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I will tell you a story of magic and love, of daring and death, and one to comfort your heart. It will be the truest story I have ever told. Now listen, and tell me if it is not so.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keturah is a gifted storyteller, most often found weaving tales by the fireside. When she becomes hopelessly lost in the deep forest surrounding her village, she never expects that it will be her talent for storytelling that will help her thwart death among the trees. But when Lord Death arrives to bear Keturah away, she manages to enthrall him with the promise of the greatest love story ever told: a story with an ending she refuses to tell unless Death allows her to live. Her wish is granted, but it&#8217;s only a temporary reprieve. Death will come to collect her the following night unless she manages to find true love within the span of one day&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I credit Goodreads for recommending this book to me, because otherwise it might have slipped past my radar. Which would&#8217;ve been a tragedy, because I liked it quite a lot. It has a real fairy tale vibe &#8212; not a happy, fluffy, rainbows-and-unicorns fairytale vibe but a dark, brooding sort of Brothers Grimm vibe. If I had to make some comparisons, I&#8217;d say it was similar to stories like <em>The Robber Bridegroom</em> because of the darker underlying themes. But there are some comical moments as well, and I love the book&#8217;s insight into the topic of death; specifically, that death may not necessarily be something to fear, after all. I had to review this on the blog because I hate that its praises go unsung due to obscurity. I want you to know about this book, and I want you to give it a try!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1769"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Keturah &amp; Lord Death</em> is pretty much a book-length fairy tale. It pays homage to a lot of fairy tale elements, but is by no means strictly a traditional fairy tale in that sense. Keturah&#8217;s nightly bargains with Lord Death to extend her life are actually reminiscent of Scheherazade in <em>1,001 Nights</em> in the sense that she trades him a piece of a story in exchange for another day to live. But what I love about the book is that it&#8217;s so much more than what it seems to be at first glance. You may not guess it from the synopsis, but underneath the storytelling is an unconventional romance full of symbolism and just&#8230; UGH! I can&#8217;t talk about it! Suffice it to say that I loved how this book ended SO MUCH that I actually took pictures of the last few pages with my phone in lieu of highlighting entire passages. (*shakes fist at library book for lacking the highlight function* Can you tell I&#8217;m used to mainly reading eBooks??) Anyway, what I&#8217;m trying to say is that the plot feels like a fairy tale, and can sometimes be predictable in the way that most traditional tales are, but also brings plenty of its own magic. It&#8217;s unique, and consequently kind of difficult to label under any particular genre, honestly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Keturah&#8217;s personality and appreciated that she wasn&#8217;t just a flat character. Many folktales and fairy tales have heroes/heroines that lack in much personality; usually, they&#8217;re your stereotypical good guy facing impossible odds. Keturah is clever, and determined to use her wits to bargain with Death himself. These are definitely impossible odds, but she refuses to let it bog her down. I love that Keturah&#8217;s proximity to death only made her love life even more. She doesn&#8217;t just love life, she begins to embrace it all the more ever since her encounter with Death in the forest. Every day becomes that much more precious, and every person in her life takes on even more importance, because she knows that her storytelling might not be enough to win her another day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m taking it down by one star though, because there were times during the story when my attention wandered because nothing much was going on. And, even though Keturah isn&#8217;t lacking in personality, pretty much all of the other characters who also lived in her village were rather lifeless in comparison. These were definitely stock characters, as generic as any minor players you might find in a folktale. I guess it served the purpose of making Keturah stand out more, though.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A relatively short read, Keturah &amp; Lord Death is a story that borrows many elements from traditional fairy tales, but still manages to have a certain somber beauty of its own. It houses a unique, unconventional love story within the bones of what sounds like a typical folktale, managing to portray death not as an end to life, but as life&#8217;s natural companion. I highly recommend it to fans of fantasy and fairy tales alike. Don&#8217;t miss this underrated, unusual read!</p>
