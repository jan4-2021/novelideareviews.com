Of course you are. Hereâs the December 2013 forecast for <em>A Novel Idea!</em></h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_blognews" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png" width="106" height="106" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Paola&#8217;s back! </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a nice long break from blogging in November while I was working on NaNoWriMo. My brain is very, very tired, but I did miss being here. I feel refreshed and ready to jump back in for the end of the year! I have so much to catch up on though &#8212; I&#8217;m pretty sure my TBR pile only managed to grow. What&#8217;s everyone been up to? What have you been reading? And for those of you who participated in NaNoWriMo with me this year, how did it go for you?? My final word count was 53,717. Translated: NOWHERE NEAR BEING FINISHED. Ahahaha. Congrats to everyone who made it to 50k, but also to everyone who joined in and gave it their best, even if you didn&#8217;t reach that count. You&#8217;re still awesome~</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recaps or Forecasts?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So for a few months now we&#8217;ve been trying to post both an end of the month recap AND a monthly forecast telling you about upcoming highlights on the blog. The truth is, doing both is rather exhausting, even when they only have to be done once a month. Alix and I both work full time and it can be difficult to work these in, especially when the book haul can be a pretty big post. We may only keep one of these posts a month, but we&#8217;d like to ask our readers which you prefer: <em><strong>do you like recaps of what we&#8217;ve been up to all month, or do you prefer to know what&#8217;s coming up in the future??</strong></em> Please leave us a comment or hit us up on Twitter to let us know your thoughts!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3757"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scarletpimpernel.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4193" alt="scarletpimpernel" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scarletpimpernel.jpg" width="126" height="192" /></a>New Feature: Classically Challenged (!)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow, <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank">my insane recaps of <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen</a> (something we did for <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion/" target="_blank"><em>Classics Retold</em></a> back in September) turned out to be some of our most popular posts on the blog. It seems that many of you out there share my irrational fear of reading classics! Well, good news: we&#8217;re bringing the feature back as one of our regular shenanigans, starting with a four-part recap of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240567.The_Scarlet_Pimpernel" target="_blank"><em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em></a> by Baroness Orczy! Why this book in particular? Because I reeeaalllyyy want to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16102412-across-a-star-swept-sea?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Across a Star-Swept Sea</em></a> by Diana Peterfreund but I have to get through the original story first. Watch for the recaps every Friday this month! By the way, if you voted for my next Austen recap, the winner was <em>Emma</em> and I&#8217;ll be covering that in January :)</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_events" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png" width="106" height="106" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Round Robin Writing Project: <em>The Thirteenth Bride</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A while ago, Tory (<a href="http://tory-san.com" target="_blank"><em>The Sleeping Latte</em></a>) and I announced a collaborative writing project and went searching for any other crazy people who might want to join us in putting together an original story from scratch, with multiple writers. Lo and behold, Daire (<a href="http://doingittheopenway.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><em>Doing It the Open Way</em></a>) was willing to be part of this crackpot scheme~ We also want to send hugs to our fourth writer, Jessylyn (<a href="http://t.co/muP2N9YfAz" target="_blank"><em>Books Over Flowers</em></a>) for everything she contributed early on in the brainstorming process &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t able to continue since she ended up super busy with school, but we loved having her!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, we promised that we&#8217;d start posting chapters in December, when the November NaNoWriMo madness was over, and we&#8217;re ready to share what we&#8217;ve come up with! Stay tuned in the next week or so for more on our project, <strong><em>The Thirteenth Bride</em></strong>. WE ARE SO EXCITED KJHSDKFH. We hope some of you decide to read it! (Even if you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll probably still be excited. No worries.)</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_2PB" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png" width="106" height="106" />#2PersonBookClub: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13138635-these-broken-stars?ac=1" target="_blank">These Broken Stars</a></em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">#2PB took a break as well in November, but we&#8217;re reconvening this month to read a book that&#8217;s been the talk of the town recently: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13138635-these-broken-stars?ac=1" target="_blank"><em>These Broken Stars</em></a> by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner! We were lucky enough to get ARCs of the book from Disney Book Group, so many thanks to them for the opportunity to read it early and find out what all the fuss is about~ Are you curious too? Come chat with us at the end of the month when we discuss the book for #2PB!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/thesebrokenstars.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="thesebrokenstars" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/thesebrokenstars.jpg" width="150" height="228" /></a>It&#8217;s a night like any other on board the Icarus. Then, catastrophe strikes: the massive luxury spaceliner is yanked out of hyperspace and plummets into the nearest planet. Lilac LaRoux and Tarver Merendsen survive. And they seem to be alone.</p>
<p>Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the universe. Tarver comes from nothing, a young war hero who learned long ago that girls like Lilac are more trouble than theyâre worth. But with only each other to rely on, Lilac and Tarver must work together, making a tortuous journey across the eerie, deserted terrain to seek help.</p>
<p>Then, against all odds, Lilac and Tarver find a strange blessing in the tragedy that has thrown them into each otherâs arms. Without the hope of a future together in their own world, they begin to wonderâwould they be better off staying here forever?</p>
<p>Everything changes when they uncover the truth behind the chilling whispers that haunt their every step. Lilac and Tarver may find a way off this planet. But they wonât be the same people who landed on it.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Whatâs going on for you this month? Do you want to join us in our monthly shenanigans?? Inquiring minds want to know!</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">And don&#8217;t forget to comment and tell us if you prefer <strong>recaps/book hauls at the end of the month OR forecasts at the beginning of every month</strong>! Thanks guys!</h2>

But! We have some awesome events and features coming up so be sure to keep an eye out for those as well as plenty of reviews. :)</p>

<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3116" alt="banner_2PB" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>#2PersonBookClub &#8211; October 2013</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, itâs #3PersonBookClub this month! Special guest <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte of Gypsy Reviews </a>will be reading and discussing the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy" target="_blank">first book in the Vampire Academy series</a> with us! All three of us have heard all kinds of things about this series and now weâre determined to find out for ourselves just what all the fuss is about. Plus, itâs the perfect season for reading about vampires. We canât wait to have our first ever #3PB with such a good friend of ours!!</p>
<blockquote><p><img class=" wp-image-3848 alignright" alt="Vampire_Academy" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vampire_Academy.jpg" width="150" height="225" />St. Vladimirâs Academy isnât just any boarding schoolâitâs a hidden place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them. Rose Hathaway is a Dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. Theyâve been on the run, but now theyâre being dragged back to St. Vladimirâsâthe very place where theyâre most in danger&#8230;</p>
<p>Rose and Lissa become enmeshed in forbidden romance, the Academyâs ruthless social scene, and unspeakable nighttime rituals. But they must be careful lest the Strigoiâthe worldâs fiercest and most dangerous vampiresâmake Lissa one of them forever.Â (<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re wondering about <a href="2personbookclub-for-darkness-shows-the-stars-classics-retold" target="_blank">last month&#8217;s #2PB</a>, we read <em>For Darkness Shows the Stars</em>Â by Diana Peterfreund as part of Classics Retold! You can read all about our thoughts on this dystopian adaptation of Jane Austen&#8217;s classic novelÂ <em>Persuasion</em>!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3120" alt="banner_cantwait" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our October Wishlist</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">October is quiet month for releases that Paola is excited for (<strong>Paola&#8217;s Note:</strong> Well, I have plenty to be excited about, but I was lucky enough to get ARCs of all of them so they aren&#8217;t on my wishlist anymore haha) but it&#8217;s a whole another story for Alix! Not only is one of her all-time favourite YA series is coming to end this month but the second book in a newly favourite NA series of hers is also and the queen of romance is release the first book in her latest trilogy!</p>

This retelling it set in the same dystopian world as the previous book, which was my favourite part,Â so I&#8217;m quite excited for this</span></p>

Of course you are. Hereâs the September 2013 forecast for <em>A Novel Idea!</em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3486" alt="banner_blognews" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png" width="106" height="106" /></a>We never envisioned ourselves getting to this point in our blogging career, but <strong>Alix and I have made the decision to close all review submissions</strong>. Our schedule is pretty much booked for reviews, events and planned features all the way up until the end of 2013 (which we&#8217;re exceedingly grateful for &amp; excited about!), and there is just no feasible way we can keep up with review requests. On that note, a <em>huge</em> thank you to the authors who have submitted their books to us &#8212; we are so honored and really regret that we can&#8217;t take on more requests at this time. Our <a title="Review Policy" href="http://novelideareviews.com/review-policy/" target="_blank">review policy</a> has been updated to reflect the change and we&#8217;ve added a form that will put future submissions on our waiting list for consideration. Whew!!!</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Classics Retold</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are participating in a fantastic event called <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/2013/04/classics-retold-sign-up-post-for-19th.html" target="_blank">Classics Retold</a>, which we signed up for earlier this summer. The event focuses on choosing a classic and then tracking down its adaptations, from books to movies to television series. Alix and I chose <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2156.Persuasion" target="_blank"><em>Persuasion</em></a> by Jane Austen and will be posting for the event throughout September. You can check out <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion/">our intro post here</a> for more about our choice and the adaptations we&#8217;ll be covering. And be sure to visit some of our friends this month for their contributions to the event!</p>

<h3><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3116" alt="banner_2PB" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>#2PersonBookClub &#8211; September 2013</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every month we choose one book for both of us to read and discuss together. This month&#8217;s selection is <strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8306761-for-darkness-shows-the-stars" target="_blank"><em>For Darkness Shows the Stars</em></a> by Diana Peterfreund</strong>, a retelling of Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>. As we mentioned above, we&#8217;re participating in the Classics Retold event and signed up for <em>Persuasion</em>, so this is one the adaptations we&#8217;ll be covering. We figured, why not be super clever and combine #2PB with a book we&#8217;ll be reading for the event anyway? (I know, we&#8217;re too smart for our own good~)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fordarkness.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3489" alt="fordarkness" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/fordarkness-197x300.jpg" width="118" height="180" /></a>It&#8217;s been several generations since a genetic experiment gone wrong caused the Reduction, decimating humanity and giving rise to a Luddite nobility who outlawed most technology.</p>
<p>Elliot North has always known her place in this world. Four years ago Elliot refused to run away with her childhood sweetheart, the servant Kai, choosing duty to her family&#8217;s estate over love. Since then the world has changed: a new class of Post-Reductionists is jumpstarting the wheel of progress, and Elliot&#8217;s estate is foundering, forcing her to rent land to the mysterious Cloud Fleet, a group of shipbuilders that includes renowned explorer Captain Malakai Wentforth&#8211;an almost unrecognizable Kai. And while Elliot wonders if this could be their second chance, Kai seems determined to show Elliot exactly what she gave up when she let him go.</p>
<p>But Elliot soon discovers her old friend carries a secret&#8211;one that could change their society . . . or bring it to its knees. And again, she&#8217;s faced with a choice: cling to what she&#8217;s been raised to believe, or cast her lot with the only boy she&#8217;s ever loved, even if she&#8217;s lost him forever.</p>
<p>Inspired by Jane Austen&#8217;s <em>Persuasion</em>, <em>For Darkness Shows the Stars</em> is a breathtaking romance about opening your mind to the future and your heart to the one person you know can break it. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8306761-for-darkness-shows-the-stars" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re wondering about <a title="#2PersonBookClub: August 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/2personbookclub-fangirl/" target="_blank">last month&#8217;s #2PB</a>, we read <em>Fangirl</em> by Rainbow Rowell and will be discussing the book on release day, September 10th! Stay tuned!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3120" alt="banner_cantwait" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Our September Wishlist</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We donât do <em>Waiting on Wednesday</em> posts, but that doesnât mean weâre any less covetous than the rest. Here are two books weâre dying to get our hands on this month! What about you? Are there any new releases you might be willing to trade a major organ for? (See how I deviated into the morbid and excessive?? Errrrr)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alix&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16068905-fangirl" target="_blank"><em>Fangirl</em></a> by Rainbow Rowell</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-3195 alignleft" alt="fangirlraibowrowell" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fangirlraibowrowell.jpg" width="130" height="193" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have been mentally preparing myself forÂ <em>months</em> for the release ofÂ <strong>Fangirl</strong>! I am a Rowell fangirl through and through and when I learned that her next title would be about a young woman who is knee deep in fandom and fanfic writing for aÂ <em>Harry Potter-esque</em>Â series, I might have literally squeed. I mean how can youÂ <em>not</em> want to read that book?!?!? And then we got approved for an ARC of it and I freaked out in the best possible way!!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shadows.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3487 alignright" alt="shadows" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/shadows.jpg" width="130" height="192" /></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Paola&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465456-shadows" target="_blank"><em>Shadows</em></a> by Robin McKinley</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*flails* Guys. GUYS. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve realized this, but I probably number among the world&#8217;s most maniacal Robin McKinley fans. I own and have read ALL of her books. Several of them are completely worn out from repeated re-reading and having to live under my pillow because I can&#8217;t live without them. I&#8217;ve known about this upcoming new release from her for ages now but didn&#8217;t realize it was out in September until very recently. And then a few days ago I saw it was available for request on Netgalley and pretty much had a massive nervous breakdown. Obviously I requested it, so be prepared for my spiral into despair if I don&#8217;t get approved. There will be weeping. Much, much weeping. If you haven&#8217;t discovered Robin McKinley yet, what are you waiting for?? She&#8217;s an <em>incredible</em> and award-winning fantasy author!!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s going on in your world this month? And do you have any suggestions for future shenanigans you&#8217;d like us to be involved in?? Do tell!</h2>

Of course you are. Here&#8217;s the August forecast for <em>A Novel Idea!</em></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_comingsoon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3118" alt="banner_comingsoon" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_comingsoon.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Novel Idea Turns 5!</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not, this little corner of the internet has been around since 2008! For the first four years of its existence, <em>A Novel Idea</em> was more of a personal blog and I never promoted it as a full-fledged book blog. And then I decided to come back and make book blogging a bigger part of my life, which is honestly one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. Thanks to this blog, I&#8217;ve met so many amazing people, become better friends with my fabulous co-blogger Alix, and now I pretty much ALWAYS have someone to talk about books with! <strong>In honor of our 5th birthday, we&#8217;re unveiling a shiny redesign of the blog on Monday, August 5th.</strong> We hope you find some time to stop by and tell us what you think! (Psst&#8230; we may be giving away some books&#8230;) While we&#8217;re on the subject, if we&#8217;re down for maintenance a lot over the next few days, don&#8217;t panic. AWESOMENESS IS HAPPENING.</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_ARCqueue.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3117 alignleft" alt="banner_ARCqueue" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_ARCqueue.png" width="106" height="106" /></a></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">August ARCs</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr">August is packed with quite a few exciting new releases, some of which we were lucky enough to read and review in advance! Here are some future reviews to look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13497675-the-boy-who-could-see-demons" target="_blank"><em>The Boy Who Could See Demons</em></a> by Carolyn Jess-Cooke</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17397493-emma" target="_blank">Emma: A Latter-Day Tale</a></em> by Rebecca H. Jamison</li>
<li><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12930909-between-the-devil-and-the-deep-blue-sea" target="_blank"><em>Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea</em></a> by April Genevieve Tucholke</li>

</ul>
<h4><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3119" alt="banner_events" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gasp! A collaboration with Gypsy Reviews!</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, so excited to announce an upcoming collab with our very good friend (and Paola&#8217;s book twin) Charlotte over at <a title="Gypsy Reviews" href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Gypsy Reviews</a>! We won&#8217;t say anything more about it, except that at some point there will most likely be a long treatise on why Mulan is a Certified Badass. (Duh.) Charlotte is currently on hiatus, but if you aren&#8217;t already following her blog&#8230; YOU SHOULD BE. I sense she&#8217;ll be back with a vengeance ;D The event is scheduled for August 20-22 so stay tuned!!</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3120" alt="banner_cantwait" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our August Wishlist</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don&#8217;t do Waiting on Wednesday posts, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re any less covetous than the rest. Here are two books we&#8217;re dying to get our hands on this month! (Paola&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone&#8230;) What about you? Are you looking forward to these too??</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_alixpick.png"><img class="wp-image-3224 alignright" alt="august_alixpick" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_alixpick.png" width="120" height="181" /></a>Alix&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15768463-the-passion-of-the-purple-plumeria" target="_blank"><em>The Passion of the Purple Plumeria (Pink Carnation, #10)</em></a> by Lauren Willig</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I adore the Pink Carnation series by Lauren Willig! I read the first 8 books in over the span of 2 months and have ever since been not so patiently waiting for a new book in the series year. Set in England during the Napoleonic wars, the Pink Carnation series follows the various hijinks of delightful characters who are all in one way or another involved in spying for Her Majesty. Funny, witty, smart and just overall wonderful, I cannot recommend this series enough and am SUPER EXCITED for âThe Passion of the Purple Plumeriaâ!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_paolapick.png"><img class="wp-image-3225 alignright" alt="august_paolapick" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_paolapick.png" width="120" height="180" /></a>Paola&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167166-crown-of-midnight" target="_blank"><em>Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)</em></a> by Sarah J. Maas</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What, I told you it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise! Although I have yet to fully recover from getting rejected for the ARC on Netgalley two days before my birthday (thanks Charlotte and Alix for comforting me during my spiral into despair), I just found out Sarah J. Maas will be in L.A. for her U.S. book tour&#8230; AND I&#8217;M TOTALLY DRIVING OVER THERE!!! It&#8217;s about 4 hours away from Vegas. Plus, WORTH IT. Is anyone else going?? I&#8217;m planning to attend her signing on August 27th! If you see a crazy girl in the corner flailing her arms and sobbing into her copy of <em>Throne of Glass</em>, it&#8217;s probably me. Additional clue: there will probably be a fairly exasperated guy standing at a safe distance, wondering why he married me and subsequently found himself dragged to Los Angeles so I can fulfill a lifelong dream. HAHA. TOUGH BREAKS, HUSBAND.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s going on in your world this month? Do tell!</h3>
