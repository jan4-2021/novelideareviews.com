<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Benjamin Wood</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Literature/Fiction (Adult); Mystery</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: May 28, 2013 (Penguin Group)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13069261-the-bellwether-revivals" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>) The Bellwether Revivals<em> opens and closes with bodies. The story of whose bodies and how they come to be spread about an elegant house on the river near Cambridge is told by Oscar, a young, bright working class man who has fallen in love with an upper-class Cambridge student, Iris, and thereby become entangled with a group of close friends, led by Iris&#8217;s charismatic, brilliant, possibly dangerous brother. For Eden Bellwether believes he can heal &#8212; and perhaps more &#8212; through the power of music.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâm not even sure where to begin with <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i>, because itâs impacted me in a really wonderful but simultaneously horrible way thatâs difficult to describe. Writing is like that â youâre trying to describe feelings and you depend a lot on skill but also on luck. Some days youâre more fortunate than others, and you can describe these very complex, subtle emotions and sensations with a few words or many, but always quickly, and without too much thought â it comes naturally, like the feelings themselves. But other days you sit there and think, and think, and think, and nothing comes to you â so you have to sort of awkwardly tough it out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Iâll cheat and quote Bukowski: âFind what you love and let it kill you.â</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2009"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything in this book stuck out to me, from the characterization to the tone, everything. But the base of characterization and tone is the writing itself, isnât it? I went into <i>The Bellwether Revivals</i> with a bar set up very, very high, because Iâd read the introduction and oh, the author has a BFA in creative writing, and now he lectures in creative writing at the University of London. I expected a lot! And what did Wood do? He flew the bar to Pluto and asked me was I even trying? The prose is simply done without being simplistic, and the descriptions are lovely and detailed without being the sort of drag that youâd expect from, say, Morgensternâs original <i>Princess Bride</i> manuscript. Wood describes Cambridge so beautifully, with a foot both in romance and in reality, so much that I almost want to call that Cambridge a dream. Itâs like brewing tea â steep it too long and it gets bitter, donât steep it long enough and all you have is water. Wood has it perfectly, crisp and with substance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The dialogue is also top-notch. Itâs witty, itâs believable, which is something that Iâve really started to look for when Iâm reading. Much of the time the dialogue is so contrived I have to wonder if the authorâs ever had an actual conversation before. I canât help it. I cringe. But I knew I had a keeper when I started reading the dialogue out loud, with an accent and all the trimmings; I couldnât get through a single one without feeling the compulsion to act it out, and that hasnât really happened since Harry Potter. The characters are so lively and natural that I could not only relate to them, but I could find them in my friends and family. Wood does an excellent job of making Oscar, the protagonist (though looking back, I see this more as a technicality), incredibly ordinary, even if heâs anything but â heâs a closet intellectual who skipped college to work at a nursing home. Surrounded by people named Eden and Iris and Yin, though, and BMWs and Saabs and Alfa Romeos, houses with actual atriums and rectories, the Auvergne, telesurgery and NPD, he is just so â¦ <i>mundane</i>. Almost trivial at times, in the scheme of things? Insignificant. But his humanity amidst all of these supernatural people possessed by their studies, or their siblings â heâs the grounding of the novel. Heâs so terribly alive and it gives the novel so much depth I could drown in it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Concerning the storyline, I wonât say much, only that the foreshadowing is utterly masterful and that thereâs no defense against it â itâll ruin you. This review is my final draft, but in my first Iâd initially said that, âIf you like being held by the hand, not too tightly, just enough, and led into a maze by someone who knows the way (and you trust them, but you still feel a little niggling doubt in the back of your head), then this is for youâ; Iâd like to reword that now. If you like being held by the hand, just tightly enough to give you some comfort, and led into a maze by someone you know knows the way, then this is not the book for you. You cannot let get of the hand, and even if you could, that hand will not let go of you. The further you go into the book the more you feel that the situation is spiraling out of control, that you are well on your way to the exit but so much <i>awful</i> is happening, maybe it would be better to turn back and go to the start! But like life, there is only ever one direction you can go in â that hand has good intentions but it grips you like a vice, because you canât relive the past, you canât change the past, you have only the present, terrifying, and the future, full of <i>hope</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hope â thatâs a very large theme in the book. Wood covers it in its complexity, both sides of the spectrum, and although you will think he is kind for providing you with something to cling onto in times of trouble, you will this is more an act of cruelty than anything. Iâd written half of this review before Iâd finished the book â Iâd gotten around page two hundred and although the tension was beginning to build up and the introduction all but spoils you for the ending, my glasses were still rose-colored and I believed that everything would come neatly unknotted in the end. It didnât occur to me that this was a Gordian knot, and that the only way out is by the sword.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">â29 PAGES LEFT IâM ALMOST TOO UPSET TO CONTINUEâ â a frenzied message to my sister, Paola, over Facebook chat. But continue I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Â </b>Romance, heavy psychology (but not too much that itâll overwhelm you if youâre a layman in the area), a convoluted storyline that lets you stand flat on your feet and then <i>rips</i> the ground from underneath you â not to mention the technical aspects, perfect imagery and delicious, well-thought diction and syntax â itâs some of the finest storytelling Iâve ever had the pleasure and the misery of being a part of (even if small), and I donât put that lightly. I was legitimately hurt by this book, like Benjamin Wood lied to and used me and then left me out with the waste, and thatâs why I have to give it five stars. As much as it ruined me, I could never regret having read it; itâs monumental, a thriller, and if this is only Woodâs debutâs novel then I donât know what Iâll do when he publishes more. Buy them, probably.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you Penguin Group &amp; NetGalley for providing us with an ARC of this book!</p>

<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FF04_secretkeeper.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1206" alt="FF04_secretkeeper" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/FF04_secretkeeper.png" width="150" height="227" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13508607-the-secret-keeper" target="_blank"><em>The Secret Keeper</em></a></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Kate Morton</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Historical Fiction, Mystery</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Laurel Nicholson, the memory of one particular summer afternoon in the English countryside is still as fresh and vivid as ever, even after fifty long years. All she has to do is close her eyes and once again she&#8217;s sixteen years old, dreaming of a bright future in her childhood tree house. Those dreams are cut short by the shocking crime Laurel witnesses from her hidden perch &#8212; a murder, and a deep secret, that challenges everything she thought she knew about her family. Half a century goes by before Laurel finally returns to put the pieces of the puzzle together. What she uncovers is the long-buried history of three strangers whose paths collide in the years before and during the Second World War, and whose intertwining fates will ultimately lead to the indelible events of one summer afternoon in 1961.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a huge Kate Morton fan, I was beyond excited for this book &#8212; she&#8217;s a gifted storyteller whose characters remain with you long after you turn the final page. I have to say this is her best work yet, and my favorite so far. <em>The Secret Keeper</em> is a beautifully rendered tale of family secrets, unconditional love, and new beginnings set against the dramatic backdrop of wartime London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1205"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think the true genius of this book lies in its characters, who are so well drawn and so nuanced that you have a hard time writing them off as purely fictional. The story alternates between the present and the past, as Laurel investigates the truth behind what she saw when she was sixteen. We watch that truth unfold through the complex relationships between Dorothy, Vivien, and Jimmy, who meet by chance in the years before WWII. Jimmy is an aspiring photographer who is fighting to break free of his humble beginnings and make a new life for himself and his fiance, Dorothy. Dorothy, meanwhile, has ambitions of her own. She wants more than anything to be as glamorous as Vivien, who lives across the street from the house where Dorothy lives and works as a companion to an elderly heiress. While the two ladies are brilliantly conveyed in their own right, it&#8217;s Jimmy who will quietly take front and center. You won&#8217;t be able to forget him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three come from completely different worlds, and yet still find themselves linked to one another by a drama that will change everything. The best word for it is &#8216;bittersweet&#8217;, and don&#8217;t blame me if you find yourself blinking away tears while you read. I totally warned you. Kate Morton&#8217;s books are always extremely atmospheric, rich in detail without bogging you down with trivialities, and <em>The Secret Keeper</em> is no different. You are transported to a different time and place, which is what historical fiction should do. But it&#8217;s the underlying mystery that will keep you up late at night, as Laurel unravels events that happened before she was born and yet ultimately set the course for her own life. It&#8217;s a journey taken through old letters and sepia photographs, trunks stowed in attics and yellowed notes pressed between book covers. I couldn&#8217;t put it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mystery is well constructed. The plot comes together little by little, but it never gets dull or feels slow-paced at all. Oh, and the major, massive, HUGE plot twist in the end?? I never saw it coming. Suffice it to say that I was utterly floored. And if you know anything about me, you know that any book that manages to pull the wool over my eyes immediately earns my respect. (I fancy myself to be an accomplished literary sleuth, nerdiness be damned.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, this earned <strong>a perfect score</strong> from me. And I don&#8217;t hand those out freely, so keep that in mind. As mentioned, I&#8217;ve harbored an undying love for Kate Morton ever since I read <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6746018-the-distant-hours" target="_blank"><em>The Distant Hours</em></a> two years ago. (I recommend that one too.) If you&#8217;re a history geek, are fond of period dramas like <em>Downton Abbey</em>, or just really, really like to have your heart broken in the best way possible, then you need to go get yourself this book. Right now. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m finally getting to talk about it. I swear I&#8217;m still thinking about it and I read this last November. HIGHLY recommended.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jacquelyn Mitchard</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 218 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The world is different at night. Allie and her two closest friends, Rob and Juliet, know this better than anyone. The three all share the same genetic condition: Xeroderma Pigmentosum, a fatal allergy to sunlight. The only world they can truly live in is the one that emerges when the sun goes down. They have been friends forever, banding together against the disease that has every possibility of claiming their lives before they can even begin to truly live. But being unable to tolerate daylight doesn&#8217;t prevent the trio from trying to get as much out of life as they possibly can. They explore the streets and unearth buried secrets by the light of the moon, having the run of Iron Harbor from dusk until the last few hours before dawn. But it&#8217;s when they take up parkour, a stunt sport involving climbing and vaulting off tall buildings, that the thrill factor hits the ceiling. And it&#8217;s because of this need for a thrill that they find themselves witnessing something they shouldn&#8217;t have seen, what no Daytimer would ever have known about: murder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea behind this book is, I think, brilliant. It covers rarely explored territory, promises a suspenseful plot. This is why I was drawn to it in the first place. And it isn&#8217;t that the plot lacks action or mystery, because it has those things &#8212; it just all suffers from poor execution. <em>What We Saw At Night</em> falls victim to a lot of tension that ultimately fizzes out far too soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1041"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book does do a fantastic job of giving you an insider&#8217;s look at what life is like for a teenager with XP, I think that it captures that with incredible accuracy and a lot of relevance. Allie is a decent heroine who does her share of teenage quibbling but otherwise is very good about not annoying me. Did I find myself wishing she would stick up for herself more, and not just in her head but also out loud? Sure. Did I wonder why on earth she was friends with Juliet (a bitch) and Rob (practically a non-entity) aside from the fact that they all have XP? Absolutely. But she was okay, and she evolves from being reactive to proactive by the end, so I considered her redeemed to an extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some genuinely creepy moments in this story, moments that had me glancing nervously over my shoulder despite the knowledge that it was all purely fictional. The thing that makes the creepiness work is that the chilling bits could all be very real. The villain is someone who could exist very easily right down the street from you, someone you might even know. If you&#8217;ve ever watched a Dateline special, you&#8217;ll understand. It&#8217;s those small details that scare you, the telltale signs that something isn&#8217;t quite right. That someone is following you. That someone is watching your every move, leaving these subtle hints because they know you&#8217;re going to find them. They want you to find them. Allie, our protagonist, starts experiencing all these things right after being the only one to pursue the fact that she and her friends probably saw someone get killed. She&#8217;s determined to find out what happened, and the killer knows it. It&#8217;s terrifying to think that Allie, not quite seventeen, is facing down so much evil essentially on her own. This is a villain who is smart, resourceful, an adept liar, and masquerading as a decent person. He has a respectable job, a well-known family, kids of his own. He&#8217;s also a complete sociopath, and he will stop at nothing to make sure Allie never talks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the suspense, no matter how good it is, gets mired in choppy narrative and conversations that veer away from the topic way too often. Yes, I realize that normal conversations between normal teenagers (or normal people in general) don&#8217;t conform to rigid scripts, but this was really just too much for me. There are inside jokes that are explained after the fact but which leave you feeling more excluded than part of an intimate trio of friends. An intimate trio of friends who, by the way, never managed to convince me that they really were as close as they claimed to be. For one thing, Allie seems to be the outsider in the group from page one. And it&#8217;s not just me who thinks that, Allie does too. She feels inadequate compared to gorgeous, agile, practically perfect Juliet, and she feels neglected by Rob, who never seems to notice her the way he notices Juliet. (She is, of course, attracted to Rob, because this is YA and we NEED to have a love triangle.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the story begins, there are already these growing rifts between the three that anyone could spot a mile away. For one thing, Juliet is a straight up d-bag in every sense of the word. At least, this is how she came off to me. She&#8217;s manipulative, quite a bit condescending, and constantly tries to convince Allie that her thoughts and ideas are ridiculous. What kind of a &#8220;best friend&#8221; is that? And don&#8217;t get me started on Rob, who is barely a character at all because he only exists in conjunction with either Allie or Juliet and has no real personality of his own. The girls believe in him, and therefore he is a real boy. That&#8217;s about all there is to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What really ruins things though is that all of the really good moments, the suspenseful bits, the chilling revelations, get lost in the shuffle and become ineffective as a result. The tension and the element of fear should be carried through with faster pacing, otherwise it doesn&#8217;t feel urgent or even mildly dangerous. Like I said, the narrative is choppy and jumps around from spans of days to entire months going by, sometimes with nothing crazier happening than Allie taking AP Lit over the summer and reading tons of books. I mean, a story about a murder and a sociopath serial killer should make you so anxious that you can&#8217;t put the book down. You&#8217;re that worried about what might happen next, when the killer will strike or try to silence Allie forever. He does some crazy things, some really disturbing stuff comes to light, but it&#8217;s all so few and far between. You forget about it between one incident and the next. It&#8217;s not until closer to the end that the loose narrative starts to wind you up, when things start hitting Allie hard and fast. It&#8217;s a short book as it is, but most of it felt wasted to me. There are like three pages where she rehashes things she learned from a criminal justice textbook, just an info dump of massive proportions. It&#8217;s stuff like this that dulls the book&#8217;s otherwise sharper edges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was also bothered by the fact that I turned the final page only to discover that this is, in fact, going to be a series. I was thinking it would end in one installment, but nope. Do I think it could&#8217;ve been one book? Yes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take out all the extraneous crap and focus on the action, imminent danger, and very real, believable fear and you would have one hell of a good standalone book, I think. But this fell short for me in a big way. I&#8217;m pretty sad about it because I expected more.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR:</strong> Robin Wasserman</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT:</strong> eBook, 450 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are books I&#8217;ve read, long books that pivot back and forth between the past and the present, that nevertheless make you feel like the dense number of pages is nothing at all. The story flies by, those pages slipping by one after another until suddenly the story has ended and you&#8217;re left wondering where the time went. (No joke &#8212; I have had black hole moments like this while reading. &#8220;I started reading at 2pm and now it&#8217;s bedtime&#8230; what?&#8221;) There are books that you just get lost in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, this book was not one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I hate to say it, because I really expected myself to enjoy this. Nora Kane, the kind of girl who does jumpy-claps over dusty leatherbound first editions of ancient manuscripts, really seemed like someone I would be kindred spirits with. She parses through Latin translations as a calming exercise while others her age probably indulge in things like bubble baths or spa pedicures. She&#8217;s got a great group of friends, it&#8217;s senior year at a school she fought hard to even attend, and now she&#8217;s got a new gig: translating Latin for a college professor&#8217;s mysterious, mind-boggling pet project. When Nora is handed the bundle of letters written by a woman named Elizabeth Weston in a century long past, she has no idea that everything is about to change. The letters, after painstaking translation on Nora&#8217;s part, begin to reveal several lifetimes worth of secrets &#8212; secrets that plunge Nora into a quest and a conspiracy that has existed for centuries. Blood is spilled, lives are lost, and everything thought to be true must suddenly be questioned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-917"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Yes, Please:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The premise is undeniably exciting. If you&#8217;ve heard of the book before this, then you probably know it&#8217;s constantly being referred to as a YA Da Vinci Code. I can see the merits in that comparison, given that Nora&#8217;s story involves globetrotting, sifting through grave dirt, breaking into historical landmarks, and offending shadowy secret societies that subsequently hunt her across Europe. I love that there is so much history in the story. I love that Elizabeth Weston was a real woman, and that a lot of the book&#8217;s details are indeed factual. If you&#8217;re a nerd like me and tend to take to the Internet after reading a book involving history, you&#8217;ll find that Wasserman&#8217;s research is on point. The crux of the plot and the opposing forces she invented to suit that research are also fairly convincing. She handles an age-old controversial topic &#8212; religion &#8212; and weaves her fictional conspiracy with existing truths. That part was, I thought, very well done.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nora, while not necessarily someone I found myself particularly caring for, was very clearly defined. Her relationships with her friends are realistic. Unlike some other YA novels, the dialogue is also believably age-appropriate. The characters talk the way you&#8217;d expect them to. They&#8217;re teenagers who go to an exclusive school, dabble in things like Latin, and are secretly nerds. You get all of this from their interactions with each other. There is a closeness and a sense of camaraderie about the group that doesn&#8217;t feel forced. You never get the sense that the author is writing her dialogue while thinking, &#8220;Teenagers talk like this, right?&#8221; She&#8217;s very in tune with her characters. She knows what normal teenagers sound like. And she knows about grief, which is something that haunts Nora from the first paragraph to the final page. So, while I didn&#8217;t bond with Nora, I thought she was well written. She was consistent and clear. Wasserman doesn&#8217;t shy away from her heroine&#8217;s flaws, either.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had no problem at all with the writing. In fact, it was really beautiful at times. If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who fears purple prose like the evil eye, then fear not &#8212; The Book of Blood and Shadow isn&#8217;t purple. But it is lyrical, and while the pacing is slow, the story is crafted with care.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not So Much:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought this book dragged on forever. The story inches along, one minute discovery after another, one translated Latin phrase after another, until I thought I was about to go insane. I had to take frequent breaks. Also, sometimes I found myself intensely bored with what was happening. There&#8217;s a lot of internal monologue going on, obviously, because it&#8217;s told in first person from Nora&#8217;s point of view. Everything revolves around what happened on one particular night &#8212; the night Nora&#8217;s best friend is murdered, the night that her strange quest begins &#8212; but there is also a lot of exposition before we even get there. I don&#8217;t mind exposition, I really don&#8217;t, but I thought it was overdone. The author is really good at conveying the relationships between her characters, so all the extra wasn&#8217;t necessary. I got that Nora and her friends were close. I understood that losing this was devastating. We didn&#8217;t need 100+ excess pages to show that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also aggravating: the book&#8217;s plot twists, which arguably should have been its main selling point and driving force, fell terribly flat for me. Every supposed &#8220;twist&#8221; came off as really transparent. I swear I spent most of the book screaming, &#8220;DUH!!!&#8221; in my head while Nora was STILL trying to puzzle out something so obvious and so encrusted with context clues/foreshadowing/proverbial breadcrumbs that I&#8217;d figured it out 50 pages beforehand. And if there&#8217;s anything that turns me off about a book, it&#8217;s predictability. Nothing was particularly shocking at all. For being such a smart girl, Nora does a LOT of dithering. And wallowing in denial. I mean, the truth is RIGHT THERE. It&#8217;s SO OBVIOUS. If you&#8217;re like me at all, you may find yourself burning with impatience. You&#8217;ll know who will betray her, who will prove to be trustworthy after all, who will sell her short, all eons before Nora herself realizes it. You&#8217;ll probably want to shake her. You&#8217;ll probably wonder why you&#8217;re STILL listening to her trying to puzzle out who killed her best friend when it seems like the entire rest of the universe figured it out from Day 1. And that may be enough to make you put the book down without finishing. It certainly tries your patience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latter half of the story takes place in Prague. As someone who fell in love with Laini Taylor&#8217;s Prague in <em>Daughter of Smoke and Bone</em>, I found myself really kind of repulsed by Robin Wasserman&#8217;s version of the city. Nora doesn&#8217;t seem to take in anything beautiful about Prague. The way she talks about it, the whole place is just a warren of grimy alleyways and crumbling, skeleton-lined tourist traps. I feel like Wasserman did Prague an injustice. And in this sense, I also feel like she did Nora an injustice. Nora, lover of words, lover of Latin scrolls and student of history, should have loved Prague. Never mind the fear, never mind the imminent danger &#8212; she should have loved it. She should have reveled in being there, seen the glories as well as the ravages of time. It saddened me that nothing of Prague&#8217;s grand history was included. This book could easily make you believe that only ugliness can be found there. And, unrealistically, that four teenagers can have the run of Europe armed with nothing but Google, a middling grasp of Czech, and a mouthful of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My most trivial complaint: I still have no idea what happened in the end. I really, honestly don&#8217;t. I expected to be clued in as to what the Lumen Dei really was, but that part fell through for me. There was a lot of blood, things and people burst into flames, et al etc, but I really don&#8217;t understand the Lumen Dei at all after reading 450 pages.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s a very low 3, but I have to give credit where credit is due. You will love this if you like a mystery, but it won&#8217;t be much of a mystery for you if you&#8217;re good at picking up clues. Most anyone would be a better sleuth than Nora. The only edge she&#8217;ll have on you is an awe-inspiring knowledge of Latin conjugations. You&#8217;ll like it if you enjoy books with intricate relationships between its characters, if you&#8217;re a history nerd, and if you don&#8217;t mind slower pacing. Those of you who like a lot of action: beware. There is action, but long stretches of inaction between. Overall, I wish I could say I loved it, but I&#8217;m mostly in a limbo state best described as, &#8220;Ehhhhh.&#8221; &lt;&#8211; Articulate, I know. Whatever.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR:</strong> Diane Setterfield</p>
<p><strong>PAGES:</strong> 432</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The spellbinding fictions of renowned author Vida Winter have never been particularly interesting to Margaret Lea, a bookseller&#8217;s daughter. She much prefers biographies: dissecting the lives of others, putting together the puzzle pieces in order to decipher meaning behind them. Unwittingly, however, it is not Vida Winter&#8217;s stories that draw her in, but Vida herself, who reads one of Margaret&#8217;s obscure biographies and decides to offer her the highly coveted chance at an interview. Margaret is much taken aback by this, considering she has never really wanted to interview the aging authoress that virtually every newspaper in the world would want to sit down with. Nevertheless, she finds herself in the woman&#8217;s grand home, which whispers of family secrets long buried and a life even more spellbinding than any fiction could ever be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was definitely a great book to start my year with, I loved it intensely the minute I read the first page. The plot is dizzyingly good, the prose a perfect balance between eerie and magical, and the story simply begs you to read it in the middle of January when the snow has fallen an inch thick. You want to curl up with it. It&#8217;s both inviting and yet terrifying. As a reader, it was easy to fall into step with the book&#8217;s equally bookish heroine, who is faced with unraveling the dark beginnings of Vida Winter while wrestling with the shadowy corners of her own past. Margaret never even wanted to get to know Vida Winter, she was the absolute last person who would ask for an intimate chat with literature&#8217;s most beloved and yet most mysterious author. It was an opportunity presented, she thought initially, to the wrong person. Vida herself is fiery, a force to be reckoned with even in her old age; she may be dying, but the dying light is still as sharp as it was when it was new. The two characters are in such sharp contrast to one another, but by the end, the parallels between them are visible. Margaret is content to live her own life, helping her father collect rare books for their shop, observing the lives of others as a biographer. Vida has never wanted to live her own life, but has preferred weaving new lives out of the fictions in her mind. In the end, both women are bound to each other by their secrets, and the thirteenth tale of Vida Winter &#8212; the truth &#8212; is finally told. Highly recommended read for anyone who finds books as magical as I do, and for anyone who has ever wondered what facts could be hidden behind the fiction.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
