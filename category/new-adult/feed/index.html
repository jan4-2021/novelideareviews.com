<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fantastically funny, fresh and utterly relatable,Â <em>Brooklyn Girls</em>Â by Gemma Burgess is the first novel in her brand new series about five twenty-something friendsâPia, Angie, Julia, Coco and Madeleineâsharing a brownstone in hip, downtown Brooklyn, and discovering the ups and downs and ins and outs of their âsemi-adultâ lives. The first story belongs to sophisticated, spoiled, and stylish Pia, who finds herself completely unemployed, unemployable, and broke. So what is a recent grad with an art history degree and an unfortunate history of Facebook topless photos to do? Start a food truck business of course! Pia takes on the surprisingly cutthroat Brooklyn world of hybrid lettuce growers, artisanal yogurt makers and homemade butter producers to startÂ <em>SkinnyWheels</em>âall while dealing with hipster bees, one-night-stands, heartbreak, parental fury, wild parties, revenge, jail, loan sharks, playboys, karaoke, true love, and one adorable pink food truck. And that&#8217;s without counting her roommates&#8217; problems, too. (taken from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16049612-beginner-s-luck">Goodreads</a>)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Another New Adult novel! I&#8217;m excited to see the genre growing!Â <em>Brooklyn GirlsÂ </em>(which I believe is now being published under the name <em>Beginner&#8217;s Luck: A Brooklyn Girls Novel</em>) is the first a 5 part series of novels featuring anÂ eclecticÂ group of young twenty-something women living together in Brooklyn. I really liked the premise of the book. It&#8217;s refreshing to see books that center more around finding yourself then a love story.</p>
<p><span id="more-2414"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Pia is anÂ endearing leadÂ character who grew on me through out. At first I&#8217;ll admit to not really liking her. She suffered a littleÂ <em>too</em> much from the &#8220;poor rich girl&#8221; syndrom. Pia is pretty and rich yet still the queen of self-pity. I was rolling my eyes really hard at her having to party and beingÂ <em>soooooo</em> traumatized by her first boyfriend dumping her when she was 18. I get that first heartbreaks are hard, but I found her reaction to it to be over-the-top and self pitying. Luckily, I was able to get past this once the story moved towards Pia finding a path for herself. I found her struggle to get a first job to be very relatable. It is true that nowadays companies want to hire people who have experience but when you fresh out of college without experience, it&#8217;s impossible to get hired cause no one wants to take a risk on you for you to be able to get the experience you need to get a job! It&#8217;s a truly vicious cycle. The stronger Pia who decides to take charge of her future, following her parent&#8217;s ultimatum of her either getting her life together or moving back to Zurich, was terrific! I liked how the story didn&#8217;t make her ambition of running a successful food truck easy.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What I really loved the most aboutÂ <em>Brooklyn GirlsÂ </em>is that this isn&#8217;t a book about love. Yes Pia has a love interest and loveÂ entanglementsÂ but they really are secondary to the main focus of it: finding a place for yourself on your own after college and the importance of friendship. That being said, IÂ <em>didÂ </em>enjoy the romance. I was actually surprised by it! I&#8217;m usually easily spot which guy the girl will chose, but I was happily wrong this time! Anyway, sidetrack! The friendship between Pia, Julia, Angie, Coco and Madeleine is really what made the book for me. These girls, whether they are long time BFFS or barely able to tolerate each other, have each other back. Yes there was some of the bitchinessÂ girls are infamous for but none that I consider beingÂ overlyÂ exaggerated. I think the book did an excellent job at showing female friendship in it&#8217;s various forms and the importance of women sticking together and being united. Seriously, it made me so happy to not have to deal with so many of the usual clichÃ©d girl friendship tropes! I wish more books followed this example.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Overall the story had me eye rolling a lot more then I would have liked. There&#8217;s a definite sense of priveledge to all these girls that I simply couldn&#8217;t sympathize with. While there was a lot of the clichÃ©d &#8220;<em>poor little rich</em>Â girls&#8221;-ism in the book,Â I was able to get over that for the most part but it definitely irked me throughout. I understand that rich people have struggles (God knows I hate theÂ tropeÂ of theÂ literallyÂ poor little girl who can&#8217;t find love and needs to prove herself as much when it&#8217;s the poor little rich girl), I just wish more authors would take a risk and do something different with characters with aÂ privilegedÂ background! Still, theÂ strengthÂ of the friendship and the positiveÂ portrayalÂ of it and Pia&#8217;s character growth was very enjoyable and made me happy I picked up this book and read it!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I definitely recommendÂ <em>Brooklyn Girls</em>Â especiallyÂ with summer kickstarting (beach book alert!). I&#8217;ll be picking up the next book in the series when it comes out, which will feature Angie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to St.Martin&#8217;s Press for providing an ARC of this book!</p>
