<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Mindy McGinnis</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Dystopian</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013, Katherine Tegen Books</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 320 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RELATED POST</strong>: <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days Tour Recap</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a world where fresh water is rare enough to kill for, Lynn and her mother spend their days on the roof of their house. The focus of every day is defending the pond on their property, which is their main source of water, and which is consequently a prime target for others who are desperate to survive. Life is a battle for Lynn, and it only intensifies when shots in the dark and smoke on the horizon signal both a beginning and an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, this book would&#8217;ve flown under my radar if not for my good friend <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte at Gypsy Reviews</a>, who told me I needed to pick it up while I was at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/"><strong>Dark Days Tour</strong></a> signing last month! So thanks for the recommendation, Charlotte!! I was lucky enough to meet author Mindy McGinnis during the event &#8212; she signed my book (<a href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/photo_2-2/" target="_blank">and tore the title page</a>, but she drew a smiley face next to it so all was well in the end! haha) and also signed a bookmark for me to give away! <strong>Details on how to win are at the end of this post :)</strong> And be sure to read <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">my recap of the Dark Days Tour</a> stop in Vegas for what Mindy had to say about her debut novel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3911"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> is pretty stark on the surface &#8212; Lynn and her mother are fighting for survival in a bleak, dystopian society. I know a lot of us have had enough of dystopia in YA these days, but I have to say that this one stands out from the crowd. Not only is the survival aspect very realistic and believable, it&#8217;s also infused with an undercurrent of hope and the possibility of change for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that it was such a no-frills narrative. The writing is readable but not so simplistic that it detracts from the emotional content. You really get a feel for the kind of life Lynn leads, which is not forgiving or easy at all. The environment is harsh, riddled with dangers that need to be guarded against at all times. From a very young age, she&#8217;s been forced to sink or swim. Sometimes when I read dystopia, it&#8217;s really hard to get into the atmosphere because too many frivolous things litter the story &#8212; love triangles, insta-love, extraneous drama &#8212; all the usual suspects that make it seem like they&#8217;re too busy being emo to actually get to the business of surviving. This isn&#8217;t the case with <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>. Every minute of every day is precious, and every day in itself is hard won.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist, Lynn, has never known a world that didn&#8217;t demand this kind of struggle. She&#8217;s been raised by her mother, learning to grow a thick skin and move through life without hesitating to kill if that&#8217;s what it takes to survive another day. They defend their pond against man and beast &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter who. And because she&#8217;s been raised to trust no one but her mother, Lynn is a character that sometimes displays a really callous personality. It kind of bothered me at times just how unfeeling she could be, but it&#8217;s worthwhile to remember that this is all she&#8217;s ever been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until events cause massive change in her life, Lynn is resistant to any type of change at all and even more resistant when it comes to depending on other people. She&#8217;s wary of going beyond the small circle of her comfort zone, and the crazy thing here is that what&#8217;s &#8220;comfortable&#8221; for Lynn would probably be SUPER uncomfortable for a big baby like me, haha. The good thing is that she undergoes this massive amount of growth by the time the story ends. She&#8217;s still tough as nails, and she still has a very black and white, straight up survivalist outlook on life, but her heart becomes more open. She experiences love and friendship that temper her previous experiences of loss and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a romance in this book, but it&#8217;s pretty low key. The highlight of the story is Lynn&#8217;s relationship with a little girl named Lucy who teaches her both how to care for another person and how to be cared for in return. I really appreciated this aspect of the story, as well as Lynn&#8217;s growing acceptance and eventual friendship with her neighbor, Stebbs. Overall, what makes this novel is not the stark reality of a world without fresh water and what that means; instead, it&#8217;s about fighting for the people you love.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a solid standalone novel and one that I recommend for anyone looking for a true survival story &#8212; the author knows her stuff! As she mentioned during the Dark Days event, her actual lifestyle is very similar to Lynn&#8217;s! (Not because she shoots people from her roof if they come near her pond&#8230; haha!)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Stacey Jay</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 256 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The domed city of Yuan is the only safe haven for miles in the harsh deserts of Isra&#8217;s dying planet. The lands outside the dome are prowled by the Monstrous &#8212; mutated beasts like Gem. They were once human, and are now shunned from the cities where those without mutations dwell in privilege and even luxury. Their safety comes at a terrible price, however; a price that Isra knows too well. The blind princess of Yuan keeps many secrets, not all of which are her own. Her path collides with Gem&#8217;s when the starving Monstrous attempt to steal the source of Yuan&#8217;s prosperity and fail. What unfolds is a friendship, and then a love, that could change the fate of their world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a huge fan of fairytales and an even bigger fan of fairytale retellings, especially creative ones. I&#8217;ve read quite a few of these over the years, but I have to say that <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> is by far the most unique version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. And you know, sometimes I just get this gut feeling about a book&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to explain, but some books I just KNOW I&#8217;m going to love. I read the synopsis and DONE, let me have it RIGHT NOW. This was one of those inexplicable moments of book serendipity for me. (I mean, just read the synopsis&#8230; OF COURSE THIS WAS MEANT FOR ME. Hello???)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3300"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to being the most unique <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> retelling I&#8217;ve ever come across, <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> also holds the record for creepiest use of that fairytale&#8217;s rose motif. Seriously. I challenge you to find creepier roses than the ones in this book. It was only one of the many creative twists the author implemented. In fact, the world building and storyline are so well developed that the original fairytale is more like the bone structure underneath, giving the plot its shape but not constricting it. I&#8217;ve found over time that this is my favorite kind of retelling, because you can still trace it back to its fairytale roots, but it can also stand alone as something entirely unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought Isra in particular was a fantastic piece of character development all around. With every revelation, every little piece of her world that turns out to be a lie, she loses her footing but rallies and goes two steps further than she did before. This girl&#8217;s a fighter. Despite being born within the Dome and not having to deal with the unforgiving environs of the desert outside, despite never wanting for food or shelter, Isra is still at quite a disadvantage in the beginning of the story. For one thing, she&#8217;s been blind since childhood, which makes the lies that imprison her all the more difficult to detect. But as the story progresses, and as she forms a bond with Gem and begins to question everything she&#8217;s been forced to accept, Isra just gets tougher and tougher. She&#8217;s determined to deal with things in her own way, with this inherent bossiness that perfectly suits her, but also a deep compassion and empathy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually it&#8217;s the Beast that holds Beauty captive, but in this story it&#8217;s the other way around. When Gem and his fellow Monstrous are caught trying to steal the roses that are the heart of Yuan&#8217;s magic, Isra orders her guards to spare Gem&#8217;s life, and he becomes her prisoner. Their relationship starts with them at odds with one another, basically hating each other&#8217;s guts, and I <em>loved</em> that things were so complicated. I also loved that Isra was not necessarily in a position of power just because she was a princess; there are a lot of political machinations at work in this story that thrilled me because I enjoy that kind of thing. She was as much of an outcast in the domed city as Gem, if for different reasons. They&#8217;re both complex characters with secrets and agendas of their own, with a lot of differences to reconcile between them. This made their romance so much more gratifying to me. It was hard-won, and therefore felt more real and worthwhile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was so impressed with the depth and creativity of this alternate version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. If you&#8217;re a lover of fairytales, high fantasy, or even science fiction (this one has a bit of a sci fi twist to it here and there, although the fantasy aspect is more prevalent), then you should definitely give <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> a try. This is <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> like you&#8217;ve never seen before. I absolutely loved it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for more retellings of favorite fairytales? Here are some of my favorite twists on <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/" target="_blank"><em>Cinderella</em></a>, <a title="#3: SPINDLEâS END" href="http://novelideareviews.com/spindles-end/" target="_blank"><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></a>, and <a title="#2: EAST" href="http://novelideareviews.com/east/" target="_blank"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></a>. Ah, and some shameless plugging: if you remember the <a title="The Round-Robin Project" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-round-robin-project/">Round Robin writing project</a> I announced on the blog last month, then you may be interested to know that the girls and I decided to write an epic fairytale retelling ourselves! So stay tuned for more on that in the coming months :)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Cristin Terrill</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: September 3, 2013; Disney Hyperion</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC via Netgalley; 368 pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You have to kill him.&#8221; Imprisoned in the heart of a secret military base, Em has nothing except the voice of the boy in the cell next door and the list of instructions she finds taped inside the drain.</p>
<p>Only Em can complete the final instruction. Sheâs tried everything to prevent the creation of a time machine that will tear the world apart. She holds the proof: a list she has never seen before, written in her own hand. Each failed attempt in the past has led her to the same terrible presentâimprisoned and tortured by a sadistic man called the doctor while war rages outside. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13514612-all-our-yesterdays" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This one has been getting rave reviews all over the place lately, and for good reason. From the first page, <em>All Our Yesterdays</em> pretty much grabs you by the wrist and pulls you into a tangled timeline of alternate futures. As Em and Finn desperately work to unravel the past that eventually plunged their future into darkness, I was left completely breathless by the pacing and plot. There&#8217;s not a moment to lose in their quest to prevent the worst from happening, which also means there isn&#8217;t a dull moment in the whole book. And that ending!! Ugh. I just really, highly recommend this book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, Em and Finn = ALL THE FEELS. I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. I loved these two together. I loved that their impossible mission and all the failed attempts they&#8217;d made only served to bring them closer together. They support one another, and when one falters the other swiftly stands up to shoulder the burden. I really appreciated the kind of relationship they had, but I also really liked them both separately too. Em is a tough girl who didn&#8217;t start out that way; you can see the kindness and compassion in her character in those moments when she hesitates to do what she set out to do. You&#8217;d think this kind of hesitation would be irritating, since every time Em can&#8217;t bring herself to pull the trigger is another missed chance to complete their mission. But I liked that she had a heart. I liked that she was unable to let go of the good memories, the good things about the past, despite the terrible things that made her into the person she is now. And um, let&#8217;s not start talking at length about Finn because I might babble forever. Suffice it to say that he&#8217;s the equivalent of a hand to hold when you&#8217;re afraid, reaching out at just the right second. It warmed my heart to see the way he was always able to remind Em that there was still hope left in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What fascinates me about time travel books is all the cause and effect. I love tracing the steps that led to a certain outcome, which is something that <em>All Our Yesterdays</em> incorporates into its plot. As the story unfolds, more and more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. In a world where time travel is possible, time itself becomes fluid and changeable. Em and Finn try again and again, removing pieces and changing the past in an effort to find a path that leads to a different future. There are so many possibilities, so many scenarios. Each one subtly or drastically alters what that future looks like. So far, they haven&#8217;t been able to fix it so that the chain of events is disrupted. Every single time, no matter what element they take away or replace, the same fate is still waiting at the end. But they don&#8217;t give up &#8212; they just keep going, learning from each subsequent failure. It&#8217;s one of those stories that begins at the end. If you&#8217;re not a fan of shifting points of view or flashbacks, then you may not like the way All Our Yesterdays is told. To be honest, I had a pretty biased preference for Em&#8217;s chapters over Marina&#8217;s, but overall I&#8217;d say that the author handled switching between the two narrators really well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered shortly after finishing the book that it&#8217;s actually the first in a planned series, which admittedly made me kind of nervous. I went into it believing it was a standalone and was kind of upset by the concept of continuing the story after an ending that, while COMPLETELY HEARTBREAKING was also rather satisfying. I mean, after the severe facepunch to the feels that I received in the closing chapters, I found myself relieved when it was over because it ended on a hopeful note, with the promise of a happy ending. Now I&#8217;m fighting the urge to hide in a corner because I&#8217;m anticipating yet more twists and turns that will leave me sobbing all over again, haha! I&#8217;ve had some time to consider the whole sequel thing and I think I&#8217;m okay with it now. It was just a bit unsettling &#8212; like if you were on a crazy rollercoaster, finally coasted to a stop, then found out that NOPE the ride wasn&#8217;t actually over yet. GET BACK IN YOUR SEAT CAUSE WE&#8217;RE DOING THAT ALL OVER AGAIN, facepunches to the feels and all. I finally felt okay with this when I considered the fact that at least I would get to spend more time with <del>Finn</del> Em AND Finn&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>All Our Yesterdays</em> truly impressed me with characters that won my heart (and then broke it), a plot that bends time and delivers nonstop action, and the kind of feels-inducing moments that make a story unforgettable. You need to read this!! Ah, I&#8217;ve had such good luck with time travel books this year. If you liked this one, you may want to try out <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597706-the-loop" target="_blank"><em>The Loop</em></a> by Shandy Lawson as well &#8212; <a title="The Loop" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-loop/" target="_blank">my review is over here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Disney Book Group for the ARC, which I received in exchange for my honest review. Be sure to watch out for <em>All Our Yesterdays</em>, which releases on September 10th!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Alexandra Bracken</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Disney Hyperion &#8211; eNovella, 85 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="The Darkest Minds" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-darkest-minds/" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America has been ravaged by an epidemic that robbed the population of its children and transformed the ones who managed to survive. This, combined with an economic crash, has left Gabe with very few options in life. His best chance of securing a future for himself is to become a skip tracer, hunting escaped children and teenagers who have broken out of the so-called reform camps. If he collects the bounties on their heads, he might just be able to save up enough to escape his troubled past. But when Gabe captures a young girl who can&#8217;t speak, he discovers that it&#8217;s even harder to just walk away. What if the government is wrong, and these children aren&#8217;t soulless or inhuman? What if giving this girl back to her captors would be the biggest mistake of Gabe&#8217;s life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely loved this novella! I&#8217;m a huge fan of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> (as some of you might have been able to surmise by now, considering how often I babble on and on about it) and I really feel like this short story is the perfect bridge between the first and second installments. Fans of Zu, rejoice! Masochistic readers who somehow enjoy being Facepunched By Feels, also rejoice! This one is a must-read if <em>The Darkest Minds</em> broke your heart into teeny tiny pieces, then tossed those pieces into a raging bonfire. Just&#8230; be ready for the pain. In fact, start bracing yourself now. RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3014"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I always really liked Zu in the first book, and running into her again in this novella was a lot like bumping into an old friend. And by bumping into an old friend, I mean finding her on the edge of a wilderness, pursued by ruthless bounty hunters. What I love about Zu here is that she&#8217;s a total scene stealer. We get to know her in a way that we weren&#8217;t able to in book one, because that centered mainly on Ruby. I really appreciated the added depth to Zu&#8217;s character &#8212; you don&#8217;t realize just how mature she is for her age until you meet her again in this story, and honestly I never noticed just how damn sassy the girl is! Even though Gabe is the one narrating, once Zu comes into the picture you really can&#8217;t help but be drawn to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ended up loving Gabe too, despite the fact that he comes off as a total douchebag in the beginning. There&#8217;s so much desperation in him, so much pain and bitterness, and I felt like he embodied all the displaced, hopeless people who were forced to live around the Kid-Killer epidemic and the failing economy. Desperation leads people to do terrible things, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they&#8217;re bad people. A huge theme in the series so far is survival, and there are many different ways to fight for that. Gabe&#8217;s method is to push his feelings and reservations aside in order to become a skip tracer, because he doesn&#8217;t know what else to do. I loved the transformation that took place when Gabe met Zu. I loved that Zu seemed to find this goodness inside Gabe that even he couldn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; AND THEN MY HEART ENDED UP IN SHREDS ON THE FLOOR AGAIN. Who didn&#8217;t see THAT coming??</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My warning to you: the e-novella may SAY that it&#8217;s 85 pages long, and it is, but that&#8217;s because it includes the first chapter of <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16150830-never-fade" target="_blank">Never Fade</a>, </em>which is out in October. So don&#8217;t end up like me and be totally, completely facepunched by the last chapter, which I didn&#8217;t think even WAS the last chapter. It seriously was like having a door slammed shut in my face. I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT AT ALL. Ugh. I have nothing else to say. I don&#8217;t want to spoil it for you. In fact, I think I&#8217;ll just go curl up in a corner now and continue the slow recovery process. *sniff* If you haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a> yet, GO DO IT NOW. (Hint: we&#8217;re giving it away as part of our birthday bonanza.) Need further convincing, or just want to see me walking around sobbing like an idiot?

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Alexandra Bracken</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Disney Hyperion; Hardcover, 488 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A large portion of the events in <em>The Darkest Minds</em> take place on the road, on the run. It&#8217;s a dangerous chase through an America where most of the nation&#8217;s children have either died from a mysterious epidemic or emerged alive, but forever changed. Ruby, one of the survivors, has been living in an internment camp called Thurmond since she was ten years old. By the time she finds an unexpected escape from Thurmond, Ruby is seventeen and has no knowledge of how to control the strange abilities that landed her there in the first place. This is her story, but a big reason why it works is that it&#8217;s also the parallel story of friendship so strong that nothing can shatter it. When Ruby finds three other &#8220;freaks&#8221; on the road in their beat up black minivan, it changes the course of her entire life. It&#8217;s a lesson in trust, loyalty, and survival. I really feel that the bonds between Ruby, Liam, Chubs and Zu provide the heart of this story. Ruby finds a family, and the reader does too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to articulate my feelings about this book, I have to begin at the end. Simply put, the final moments of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> left my heart in shreds on the floor. Ridiculous! And it&#8217;s even more ridiculous when you consider the fact that I&#8217;d already seen it coming &#8212; I&#8217;d had this theory percolating in my brain from the time I was about 25% into the story, I knew it was going to happen (if not in this book then in one of the later installments), and yet when it DID happen it still had the effect of a massive facepunch to the feels. Seriously, my concluding notes are essentially nothing more than a long string of expletives. It&#8217;s kind of pathetic. But this is the kind of reaction I end up having when a book pulls me all the way under, to the point that I&#8217;m emotionally invested enough to care that deeply about its characters and their situation. It&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2815"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wasn&#8217;t sure how I felt about Ruby at first. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think Ruby knew what to think of herself either. She would have these moments when I just wanted to shake her &#8212; get a move on already!! &#8212; but even though Ruby is constantly at odds with her abilities, what made me love her in the end was the fact that she never hesitated to do what was necessary to survive. She doesn&#8217;t like to use her powers (I won&#8217;t tell you about them AT ALL at risk of ruining your experience, but I LOVE them and I was seriously impressed with what Ruby could do), but when it counts, when it&#8217;s down to the wire, Ruby comes through every single time. Even if it will be at great cost to herself, she delivers. And I feel like she was one of those characters I&#8217;ve encountered who had so much genuine growth by the time I turned the last page. I was pretty damn proud of this girl. Well, and also choking back sobs because of that ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And Liam! Omg help?? How is this man so adorable?? Many books have that character whose good heart gets them into trouble every time. Their compassion often becomes their downfall, which is always terrible to see because who likes to watch the nice guy finish dead last? I feel that Liam is that guy, but he&#8217;s also <em>more</em>. He&#8217;s a risk-taker, a born leader, but there&#8217;s this vulnerability to him that Ruby finds herself determined to protect. I loved that Liam taught Ruby how to trust, but even more than that I love Liam for being the light that brought Ruby out of the shadows. Liam gives her a reason to be strong. And that&#8217;s when Ruby truly comes into her own, fitting into her skin at last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America in the aftermath of the devastating &#8220;kid-killer&#8221; disease is a bleak, practically lawless place. The remaining fraction of the population lives in various levels of poverty, the suburbs abandoned and the highways empty. The author paints a grim portrait of a nation still mourning the loss of its children almost a decade since the first wave of deaths. Most have lost sons and daughters, if not to the epidemic then to the succession of buses that arrived to take the surviving children away. I appreciated the fact that this deadly, often eerie landscape wasn&#8217;t just a painted backdrop for teenage melodrama. Our characters are constantly fighting to make it to the next day, dodging skip tracers who hunt them for the bounties on their heads and even having to battle other fugitives in order to secure a safe place to sleep for the night. This journey is taken one step at a time, and practically every move forward is fought for tooth and nail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s hard for me to resist a book that elicits this much emotion while I&#8217;m reading. I can&#8217;t help loving it. I feel like the best books make that connection with you, and <em>The Darkest Minds</em> definitely resonated with me. The only reason I&#8217;m taking off points is that the book kind of crawls at times while Ruby and crew are on the road. I feel like it could have been a bit shorter without suffering for it. BUT: I was hooked from the very first chapter, and the characters made me love them, and the ending broke my heart. I&#8217;m in this until the bitter end now, guys. I HAVE NO REGRETS. Go read this!!!!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Susan Dennard</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical/Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, HarperTeen; eBook, 248 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleanor Fitt thought her family&#8217;s situation couldn&#8217;t get worse. Since her father&#8217;s death, money has been increasingly scarce, and now Eleanor&#8217;s brother has gone missing, with the only clue to his whereabouts appearing in the form of a letter crushed in the fist of an undead corpse. To make things worse, her mother unwittingly invited a malicious spirit into their home, she&#8217;s falling hard for an inventor of ill repute, and corsets make it extremely difficult to outmaneuver the undead horde. Land sakes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve heard so much about this series that picking it up was inevitable. I confess to knowing pretty much nothing about it when I requested from the library &#8212; only that it was mostly well received and had something to do with the undead. Guys, you don&#8217;t need very much convincing when it comes to this girl and a good zombie apocalypse. It&#8217;s a really interesting concept because there are, in my opinion, so many different ways to handle it. <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> brings the undead masses to 1876 Philadelphia, and while it was frequently predictable, I still thought it was a fun ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2814"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps that the heroine is easy to get along with. Eleanor Fitt is under a lot of pressure to help undo their formerly affluent family&#8217;s fall from grace. All she has to do is make a good match &#8212; which is easier said than done, because Eleanor happens to feel very strongly about being an independent woman during a time when girls and women were expected to remain resolutely in the background. It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, and Eleanor is having none of it. She has an insatiable mind, always brimming with curiosity, which of course gets her into twenty different kinds of trouble on a daily basis. It&#8217;s always nice to see a heroine who gets herself into scrapes but manages to get herself out of them, whether this means using her head or finding the nearest available baseball bat and taking out zombies with it. I liked Eleanor&#8217;s inquisitive nature and her determination to be something more than what society expected of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also thought it was interesting that there were so many mentions of body image. Early on in the story, Eleanor&#8217;s late father is quoted as having listed &#8216;a fondness for buttered toast&#8217; as one of her few vices. A lady is supposed to appear dainty and eat like a bird, plus there&#8217;s the problem of fitting into an extremely tight corset, so Eleanor is frequently hungry or even regretting taking an extra bite of breakfast. Her mother criticizes her figure, and Eleanor seems plenty aware that she isn&#8217;t the ideal size, but I appreciated that the concept was even included. I feel like it&#8217;s overlooked in other books of this genre; yes, the descriptions of beautiful dresses and tiny waists abound, but what about the problems associated with cultivating that image? To me, Eleanor was more down to earth because she struggled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the plot was predictable (I was able to guess most of the twists early on, as well as the big reveal), I didn&#8217;t feel especially bothered by it. First of all, I was intrigued by the concept of a zombie horde in the middle of 1876 Philadelphia and enjoyed the inclusion of the Centennial Exhibition as a central part of the story. The steampunk &amp; &#8216;scientific&#8217; paranormal bits were often a bit much and I ended up taking them with a grain of salt, but the author did a great job clearly defining the setting without overwhelming the reader with excessive period detail. It was sort of like&#8230; okay, I don&#8217;t really see how you could really rig an alarm to go off when the undead are near, BUT that&#8217;s fine because the characters are fun and the pacing keeps me from getting bored. (Kind of like those episodes of Ghost Adventures when they hold up some bogus piece of electromagnetic equipment and I just roll my eyes&#8230;) There&#8217;s a lot of action, with the first chapter opening with an undead attack, and there aren&#8217;t any dull moments acting as filler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, I liked Daniel immensely, but he totally punched me in the face with that ending. I mean, I don&#8217;t believe it for a second, but props to the author for choosing that moment in particular to NOT be predictable at all.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An incredibly readable book, <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> is an enjoyable excursion into an alternate Philadelphia where the dead aren&#8217;t always truly dead. A sassy heroine and a colorful supporting cast make the predictability more bearable. I&#8217;m happy to report that the conclusion of book one definitely has me excited for book two, although I can&#8217;t divulge much more than that without risking spoilers for you all. I&#8217;d say this one is one the lighter end when it comes to zombie books &#8212; if you&#8217;re looking for something really dark and full of feels, try <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8051458-the-reapers-are-the-angels" target="_blank"><em>The Reapers Are the Angels</em></a> by Alden Bell, or <a title="Warm Bodies" href="http://novelideareviews.com/warm-bodies/" target="_blank"><em>Warm Bodies</em></a> by Isaac Marion (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7619057-warm-bodies" target="_blank">book</a> AND <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588173/" target="_blank">movie</a>) for unexpected warmth and humor!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Marissa Meyer</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013; Feiwel &amp; Friends &#8211; eBook, 464 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/" target="_blank"><em>Cinder (The Lunar Chronicles, #1)</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since discovering the truth about her past, Cinder has found herself on the wrong side of the law &#8212; and the wrong side of Queen Levana, the immensely powerful, truly terrifying ruler of Luna, who wants her dead. Determined to stop Levana from bringing war to the Commonwealth, Cinder breaks out of prison with the aid of a fellow criminal and a shiny new cyborg hand. What results is the equivalent of an interstellar high speed chase while Cinder tries to figure out a way to elude her enemies and find a way to end the Lunar threat. Meanwhile, on Earth, Scarlet Benoit has problems of her own. Her grandmother has gone missing, and now a mysterious stranger named Wolf has arrived to further complicate things. It&#8217;s almost too farfetched to believe, but one clue after another seems to point to a connection between Scarlet&#8217;s grandmother and the missing Princess Selene&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every time I start the second book in a series, I always have this moment when, fingers crossed, I wish as hard as I can for immunity to Second Book Syndrome. It&#8217;s happened to me so many times before: I read a book, I love it to death, I can&#8217;t wait for the next installment&#8230; and then end up writhing in agony as Book 2 crashes, burns and smolders before my eyes. I hate that this happens and it&#8217;s one reason why I&#8217;ve gotten pretty disillusioned with trilogies (or quartets or whatever long string of sequels it might happen to be) over the last few years. I&#8217;m happy to say, though, that <em>Scarlet</em> ended up being just as good as <em>Cinder</em>. I still love the characters, old and new, and it turned out to be another example of how to rewrite a classic tale with a unique twist. (Plus, Thorne reminds me a bit of Captain Kirk. SAILOR MOON + STAR TREK = SAILOR TREK??? /dies of awesome)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2725"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I really have to say that I ship Cinder and Kai SO HARD that it&#8217;s not even funny. I love that we don&#8217;t spend all our time watching them fawning over one another. I love that they have to overcome these obstacles before they can even begin to contemplate their feelings for each other, which are as complicated as the day is long. I feel like this makes them stronger individually but also adds depth to what they could become <em>together</em>. Of course, I really like both of these characters on their own; Cinder remains both clever and resourceful, and I felt like Kai&#8217;s character only gained more dimension when he transitioned from being Prince to Emperor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this second book, Cinder&#8217;s inner conflict branches out to include her Lunar side, which she really wrestles with because the undeniable utility of her abilities clashes with her morality in so many ways. I was happy to see her beginning to accept who she is &#8212; at least, she&#8217;s starting to reconcile her human and cyborg halves, and that&#8217;s a huge thing in terms of growth for her character. Meanwhile, Kai is faced with one tough choice after another as he tries to protect his people from the Lunar threat. I love that his parts of the story show what it&#8217;s like to be in a position of power, responsible for the lives of so many.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wondering what I thought of Scarlet, the eponymous new addition to the story, and I have to say I liked her very much. I liked her fiery temper and I even liked her habit of just barreling into whatever was in her way. She&#8217;s headstrong, with an attitude that provides a contrast to Cinder&#8217;s, and I&#8217;m really looking forward to seeing these two collaborate further in the next two books. I wasn&#8217;t really sold on Scarlet and Wolf together, though. I thought things unfolded between them a little too fast and it detracted from the story a bit, for me. I would&#8217;ve appreciated putting on the brakes for these two, because suddenly they were getting really cozy and it kind of blindsided me even though I totally expected them to end up together. Yes, I knew it was going to happen, but I never thought it would happen that quickly. It might just be me, but that part was probably the one thing about book 2 that had me glowering at the page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thorne did not have me glowering at the page. I loved him immensely, and from the beginning. Our friend <a href="http://abookishheart.com" target="_blank">Asti </a>pointed out in <a href="http://abookishheart.com/reviews/bookish-reviews-scarlet/" target="_blank">her review of</a> <em>Scarlet</em> that it was super refreshing to NOT see a love triangle rear its ugly head with the introduction of Thorne, and I completely second that sentiment. Any time a love triangle is glaringly possible and the author maneuvers us away from it, I want to jump up and cheer. Thorne came along just when Cinder needed a friend, and some levity in a pretty rough (as in, wanted-fugitive-in-a-stolen-spaceship rough) situation. His exchanges with Cinder are hilarious. I JUST WANT TO HUG HIM. He&#8217;s so ridiculous.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A solid second installment in the series! Meyer has a gift for spinning something entirely unique out of the beloved fairytales we all know by heart. I can&#8217;t wait for Cress and can&#8217;t believe I have to wait until next year for it. (Hear that? It&#8217;s the sound of me crying myself to sleep.) If you haven&#8217;t given The Lunar Chronicles a try yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? How about I point you in the direction of <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/">my <em>Cinder</em> review</a>? Let me help you. I know what you need ;D</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Kat Zhang</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins; eBook 343 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For longer than they can remember, Addie and Eva have been together. Just like everyone else in the world, they were born as two souls in one body, two completely different people with separate personalities and thoughts. But they soon discover that they aren&#8217;t like everyone else at all, because one of them should have receded during childhood, leaving the other in complete control. Eva, however, is still there &#8212; the ever-present voice in Addie&#8217;s head, unwilling to simply relinquish her hold on life. Her existence could be enough to get them killed, especially in a society where hybrids are viewed as a threat. When they discover that there is a chance for Eva to regain partial control, Addie and Eva are faced with a choice between the safety of being separate and the dangerous possibilities of staying together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took me an entire month to get through this book. Not because it&#8217;s long, or unreadable, but because it is so unbelievably slow. I swear it felt like nothing much happened between the first chapter and the last. I think I&#8217;m joining the minority by disliking this book as much as I did, but man. <em>I just did not get it.</em> The pacing moves at an absolute crawl, the protagonist(s) spend way too much time dithering over what to do next, and quite frankly I thought the world building was virtually nonexistent. I turned the last page and still felt unconvinced as to the necessity of persecuting, purging, and otherwise reviling &#8216;hybrids&#8217; other than a petty vendetta against people who are different. <em>What&#8217;s Left of Me</em> just didn&#8217;t work for this girl, unfortunately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2547"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the first few chapters, I was already looking for answers that weren&#8217;t being supplied. Other than a brief mention in the synopsis, it&#8217;s hard to be clear on just where all of this stuff is taking place. For the record, it&#8217;s apparently an alternate version of our world, with an alternate history in which everyone is born with two souls. One soul is dominant, the other recessive, and people who don&#8217;t end up losing their recessive soul are considered to be hybrids &#8212; extremely dangerous, and definitely not welcome in Addie and Eva&#8217;s alternate America. Here&#8217;s the thing, though: I have no idea why hybrids are supposedly so dangerous. They never seemed to have any unorthodox abilities, no telekinetic powers or superhuman strength, et al etc. In fact, the only clear advantage I saw in being hybrid was having double the brain power to get through algebra homework faster. (No joke, Addie and Eva actually provide an example of this in the book.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, case in point, if hybrids can&#8217;t really DO anything differently than non-hybrids&#8230; why on earth do we care if they live in our country or not?? <strong>Why exactly are they a threat??</strong> I mean, did I miss something&#8230;? It was made rather obvious that foreigners were NOT wanted because foreign hybrids started a terrible war that nearly wiped out all of humanity. Fine, hybrids made bad choices about nuclear warfare. But the war is over, and yet the government seems to be harboring this borderline childish grudge against hybrids. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an intended message here about how deeply society can fear and reject what they don&#8217;t understand, but I didn&#8217;t feel like it was executed well at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, back to the world building. Which is barely there at all. Like I said, I had no idea at first whether this was a post-apocalyptic version of OUR world or a world of the author&#8217;s fabrication. I had to go back to the synopsis and see that it was indeed an alternate. I personally disliked that I was being forced to grasp at straws here. I wish there had been more clues that this wasn&#8217;t a world based on ours, because I think I would have been less confused and more able to get into the setting right from the start. Of course, I may be the only one upset about this aspect. World building is pretty important to me though, and it&#8217;s hard to portray a dystopia in an alternate world when you only allow your reader a very shallow immersion in that world. It detracts from the atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Eva&#8217;s will to survive, and I applauded her conviction to stay with Addie rather than eventually vanishing the way recessive souls are supposed to. She had these flashes of brilliance during which she actually did things; Addie, on the other hand, seemed more recessive in nature than Eva. I&#8217;m not sure what the rules are for deciding which soul is dominant vs recessive, as yet again the world building kind of failed to elaborate on this, but I really questioned how Addie was dominant when she spent more time twiddling her thumbs, hesitating about what to do next, than Eva ever did. My only strong impressions of Addie were during the times she lashed out at Eva for A) wanting to be more than a voice in the back of her head (gasp, how atrocious) and B) wanting to kiss a boy that Addie wasn&#8217;t interested in. ??? ?? ????</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, I get the massive conflict that exists when you have two souls trapped in one body. That is actually a really intriguing idea to ponder. I get that it&#8217;s terrible never having private thoughts, never just getting to be you, because you have two personalities. In the end, it&#8217;s hard for either of them to be happy. I just wish this internal conflict had been paired with a plot that was more compelling and a setting that was more defined. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m all for thought-provoking books and having to dig a little deeper to find the meaning of a story, but despite trying really hard to get something out of this experience, I&#8217;m sad to say I walked away pretty disappointed. Another case of having an awesome premise but falling short in the execution, in my opinion.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m extremely excited to spotlight one of my favorite authors this week as part of the <a href="http://nuzsaysitwithbooks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Indie &amp; Self-Published Author Event</a>: the awesome A.K. HÃ¶st! Please forgive me if the following review is borderline incoherent; I&#8217;m writing it directly after turning the last page and all the emotions are still punching me in the face&#8230;</h4>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/056_andallthestars.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2305" alt="056_andallthestars" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/056_andallthestars.png" width="150" height="231" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13411999-and-all-the-stars" target="_blank"><em>And All the Stars</em></a></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Andrea K. HÃ¶st</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 204 Pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Come for the apocalypse.<br />
Stay for cupcakes.<br />
Die for love.</p>
<p>Madeleine Cost is working to become the youngest person ever to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture. Her elusive cousin Tyler is the perfect subject: androgynous, beautiful, and famous. All she needs to do is pin him down for the sittings.</p>
<p>None of her plans factored in the Spires: featureless, impossible, spearing into the hearts of cities across the world â and spraying clouds of sparkling dust into the wind.</p>
<p>Is it an alien invasion? Germ warfare? They are questions everyone on Earth would like answered, but Madeleine has a more immediate problem. At Ground Zero of the Sydney Spire, beneath the collapsed ruin of St James Station, she must make it to the surface before she can hope to find out if the world is ending.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, I don&#8217;t read very much science fiction. I&#8217;m more of a high fantasy, embarking-on-perilous-quests, swinging-enchanted-swords kind of girl. I think it&#8217;s because the first sci fi books I ever tried felt so cold and clinical in comparison to the fantasy books I loved, with all these technical details and a lingering air of <em>so much math (??!)</em>. I realize that sounds more than a bit ridiculous BUT I can&#8217;t think of any other way to describe my lack of affinity with the genre. That being said, <em>And All the Stars</em> completely overturned every expectation I had. I love this book. It is so far from my usual fare, and yet managed to insinuate itself so close to my heart that I&#8217;m honestly still in shock right now as I write this review. There have been very few science fiction books I can say this about. I feel like if I wasn&#8217;t already a huge fan of the author, this one would&#8217;ve won me over for sure. If you haven&#8217;t picked this one up yet, <strong><em>you need to</em></strong>. Trust me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2257"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As indifferent as I&#8217;ve been to most of the sci fi genre, I will admit that I have this gross fascination for the post-apocalyptic. There&#8217;s something about the possibility of the world ending that piques my curiosity while simultaneously scaring me shitless. That giddy, panicked feeling stayed with me through most of my reading of this book, as the Spires appeared all over the world and Madeleine was trying to find a way to survive the sweeping changes overtaking the entire planet. As with anything post-apocalyptic, whether in films or in books, I always find it extremely unsettling to consider all the familiar things in life become suddenly obsolete or skewed. With this book in particular, you immediately get the sense that nothing is ever going to be same again &#8212; there&#8217;s no going back. That old way of life is dead, and now the world is divided according to the aftermath of the Spires and the chain of events that followed. Madeleine&#8217;s choices are to adapt or give up. It&#8217;s that simple, and that scary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#8217;t talk about much of the plot without horrendously spoiling it for you, so instead I&#8217;m going to talk about the characters of this novel and how much I came to love them. Madeleine, always more dedicated to her art than to cultivating friendships or relationships with others, finds herself surrounded by people she comes to love, people she supports and who support her in turn. They band together, pooling their resources, learning from one another, and face the apocalypse standing side by side. I think this warmth &#8212; these deep bonds between people all sharing a common goal &#8212; is what I&#8217;ve found missing in a lot of the science fiction I&#8217;ve read in the past. I liked every single one of Madeleine&#8217;s friends and allies, all for different reasons, and for all their varied personalities and backgrounds. They all just clicked together, each person providing something that the group needed, whether it was warmth or sustenance or security. I had no favorites, which is also extremely rare for me. I loved them all, and cared about their welfare, and found myself desperately rooting for their survival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the plot, though. Guys, don&#8217;t expect to have any idea what&#8217;s going on when you start reading this book. The experience is constructed so that you discover everything by degrees, at the same rate that the characters are learning it, and it really kept me on my toes. I was always peering around the next corner, holding my breath, wanting to know what new developments would come to the surface. I think it made it even more authentic of an experience because in real life, in the event of a disaster like this taking place, you would find things out gradually as well. You&#8217;d find things out the same way Madeleine does: through the news, via the vast social network that connects us across countries and continents, by witnessing pieces of it firsthand. No one ever knows everything that&#8217;s happening. Everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but combined, it&#8217;s like a puzzle being fitted together one piece at a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the <em>twist</em>! What! How did I miss that?! I mean, I&#8217;m not going to say anything else about it, but it really caught me off guard. I didn&#8217;t see that coming at all, and I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t help loving a book that surprises me. And I thought the plot twist in this case added a new dimension to the story, and to Madeleine, that made everything even better. (Plus, facepunched by the feels. *sobs*)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a book for sci-fi believers and nonbelievers alike. And anyway, how do you turn down a book with a synopsis that opens with <em>Come for the apocalypse. Stay for cupcakes. Die for love.</em> ???????? Hello?? PLEASE READ IT NOW. <em>And All the Stars</em> is superbly written, with characters that just leap off the page and the ability to elicit emotions that I never imagined myself feeling for a novel about the world ending. It really just blew me away. It may be my new favorite A.K.Â HÃ¶st book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m having somewhat of an A.K. HÃ¶st marathon this week, so stay tuned for tomorrow&#8217;s review of her latest novel, Hunting! I&#8217;ve got an interview and giveaway on Friday as well, so don&#8217;t miss it!!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Marissa Meyer</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 387 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cinder has a reputation for being one of the best mechanics in New Beijing. She has a gift for fixing what&#8217;s broken, even if that talent doesn&#8217;t seem to extend to her personal life. Being cyborg means limited rights and high tensions with the only family she has left, not to mention disdain from the majority of the population. But there is more to Cinder than being part human and part machine, and the mystery of her past might just be the key to securing Earth&#8217;s future&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; FIGHTING EVIL BY MOONLIGHT! WINNING LOVE BY DAYLIGHT! NEVER RUNNING FROM A REAL FIGHT &#8212; oh, we&#8217;re NOT singing the Sailor Moon theme song right now? Well, boo. I guess I&#8217;ll go back to writing this review then&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely loved <em>Cinder</em>, and not just because it brought back fond memories of watching Sailor Moon every morning when I was a kid. It&#8217;s a refreshing, original take on the Cinderella fairy tale that effortlessly incorporates new twists with familiar details. Besides, there are cyborgs. And a Prince. <em>And</em> diabolical mind manipulation powers&#8230;! What more do you need in life??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2251"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the best things about <em>Cinder</em> is Cinder herself. Well, aside from a minor snag during which I made faces at the book because her hair was described as &#8220;mousy brown.&#8221; (I just really dislike when brown hair is described as &#8216;mousy.&#8217; It&#8217;s one of my least favorite adjectives&#8230;) But everything else was awesome. I liked that Cinder was such a gifted mechanic, that she was a hard worker but not a martyr or Mary Sue about it. None of that lame, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to suffer in silence because I&#8217;m such a good person blah blah blah I don&#8217;t resent this unfair treatment at all!&#8221; nonsense. Cinder isn&#8217;t happy with her situation, but she does her best to live with it until her opportunity comes to make a change. She does feel resentful, hurt and angry. And that makes her more sympathetic, in my opinion. I just can&#8217;t get behind a heroine who simply accepts her fate, no matter how crappy it is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While it kind of bugged me that she had such a complex about being part cyborg, it was an understandable thing to feel self-conscious about, especially in a society where being half machine wasn&#8217;t exactly a celebrated thing. Besides, this is only the first book and I have high hopes that Cinder will eventually come to accept and even be proud of being exactly the person (and kind of person) she is. I personally thought her cyborg half was incredible. I mean, she has a built in lie detector, for crying out loud. Hello?? Awesome???</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My favorite thing about this protagonist: she was never standing still, just waiting for the shit to go down. I like female leads who take matters into their own hands, who make decisions that might prove to be mistakes and yet just keep rolling with the punches anyway. I liked that she was self-sufficient; she didn&#8217;t need anyone to save her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have nothing but admiration for the society and setting featured in this book, which is far, far into the future and yet still recognizable as something that could realistically evolve from world we live in right now. Sometimes sci-fi verges on the overly farfetched, with technology and other innovations that are difficult to believe or even comprehend. But I could see the future turning out to be something like the future portrayed in <em>Cinder</em>. Oh, and I thought the Lunars were pretty fascinating, with their illusions and mind games &#8212; a worthy adversary in this book, and in the ones to follow.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re still on the fence about this Cinderella retelling, I think you should give it a try. I really enjoyed the science fiction spin on the original story, and I appreciated how it seamlessly included bits and pieces of the fairy tale while still making sense. It doesn&#8217;t have the fatal flaw of being completely overtaken by romance or overburdened by details. Highly recommended, and I&#8217;m definitely going to read the rest of the series.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230;. Aaaaaand now I think I&#8217;ll go back to having the Sailor Moon theme song stuck in my head.</p>
