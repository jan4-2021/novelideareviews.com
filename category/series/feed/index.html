<h3>We are super excited to bring you thisÂ <strong>very special edition</strong> of #2PersonBookClub featuring one of our favourite people: <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com/" target="_blank">Charlotte of Gypsy Reviews</a>! Yes, you read that right. Welcome to our very first #3PersonBookClub! :) We pickedÂ <em>Vampire Academy</em> since it was a book we were all interested in reading and thought it would suit October very well. I think we were all hoping it would cleanse our minds &amp; spirits ofÂ <em>Twilight</em>Â trauma&#8230;</h3>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vampire_Academy.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3848 alignleft" alt="Vampire_Academy" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Vampire_Academy.jpg" width="150" height="225" /></a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">St. Vladimirâs Academy isnât just any boarding schoolâitâs a hidden place where vampires are educated in the ways of magic and half-human teens train to protect them. Rose Hathaway is a dhampir, a bodyguard for her best friend Lissa, a Moroi Vampire Princess. Theyâve been on the run, but now theyâre being dragged back to St. Vladimirâsâthe very place where theyâre most in danger&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Rose and Lissa become enmeshed in forbidden romance, the Academyâs ruthless social scene, and unspeakable nighttime rituals. But they must be careful lest the Strigoiâthe worldâs fiercest and most dangerous vampiresâmake Lissa one of them forever.Â (fromÂ <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/345627.Vampire_Academy" target="_blank">GoodReads</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">)</span></p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Impressions</span></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>:Â I was really glad to see that this book puts a lot of focus on the friendship between Rose and Lissa. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the first few chapters; the dialogue often makes me laugh, and Rose especially cracks me up with how scrappy she is all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>:Â The story surprised me right from the start. I was nicely confused by how a book called Vamipre <i>Academy</i> could start <i>not</i> in a school! I enjoyed how the book presented Lissa and Rose, clearly showing us that their friendship would be the centre of the story (which is nicely refreshing) and gave us enough info on the world to understand what was going on without it feeling like a knowledge. I also like the dialogue and Rose&#8217;s sassiness!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>:Â I was a little shocked by the beginning because I expected it to immediately start in the academy but it didnât. The beginning really gave us a good impression of Rose and Lissaâs relationship and how the events led up to them being in that particular situation. Already there was a little action to build up the tension in the atmosphere so it definitely helped in getting more interested and involved in the story.</p>
<p><span id="more-4047"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discussion</span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What were your thoughts on the characters?</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a></strong>Charlotte</strong>:Â Rose was pretty kick-ass haha but there were definitely sides of her I didnât expect to come across. I find that this just made her seem more dimensional rather than follow the stereotypical route of making her defined by one single definition. It was good to know that Lissa wasnât as helpless as she was made out to be and that she is quite capable on her own.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I definitely enjoyed all the other characters too, Dimitri for example. He does give off the mysterious and brooding vibe but he has his priorities in place which I definitely appreciate.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: I love Rose but also felt drawn to Lissaâs character because she sort of came out of the woodwork about halfway through and I was touched by how determined she was to help protect her friend, even though it started to get a bit out of hand. I loved Dimitriâs moments of sudden kindness; definitely not what I expected out of his personality when he first came into the story and I was really happy to see that about him.</p>
<p>Back to Rose though, I loved her spirit and all her sassy comebacks! On the back of my copy of the book it says itâs âThe obvious heir to the Twilight throne,â<em> (Alix&#8217;s note: WHOEVER SAID IS WRONG)</em>Â and I have to totally disagree because there is no way Rose would spend even 5 minutes with Bella Swan without wanting to kick her ass. This is NOT Twilight at all <em>(Alix&#8217;s note: AGREED).</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Um also I am now terrified because Lissa and Christian make me happy which must mean horrible things are in store for them in later booksâ¦ *runs away crying*</p>
<p>Last thing: I find it incredibly, overwhelmingly adorable that Dimitri calls her âRoza.â STOP IT. STOP BEING SO ADORABLE.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: I agree with Paola and Charlotte! I love how badass Rose is! But also a complex character. Discovering her through the story was fantastic and even though this is longer series, I felt like her character really developed in this story. She started off as the stereotypical tough girl but was revealed to be so much! I really loved her POV and she was quickly my favourite character, even when I found head strong. :)</p>
<p>I also really like Lissa. I love how they made Lissa the ying to Rose&#8217;s yang while also making them so similar. As Lissa finds her voice and strength, you see that on many levels, she is as badass as Rose, just in a different way!</p>
<p>Since Paola and Charlotte covered what made Lissa and Rose awesome, I want to talk a little about Dimitri. Yes, Dimitri is Rose&#8217;s love interest but Mead made him into so much more then that! Clearly he&#8217;s also damaged but in a interesting manner that made me want to know more! I also really like how they developed and his relationship with Rose. I love their interactions and how the story dealt with their mentor/mentored/fellow guardian dynamic AND ALSO THEIR AGE DIFFERENCE. Another reason why this book is NOT Twilight: Rose and Dimitri actually addressed the fact that he is older then her and that is a problem and can be seen as creepy! And we&#8217;re not talking hundred years like Bella and Edward; we&#8217;re talking 7 years, WHICH IS TOTALLY A LOT when you are 17 and 24! Side note: I still totally wanted them to hook up. ;)</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5dcead04-abdc-d573-16ab-6db942a6faa0" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What did you like/dislike about the book?</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: I LOVED the world building. Seriously, such an interesting universe of vampires and protectors. I like that there are different kinds of vampires and the dhampirs. I didn&#8217;t necessarily like the whole dhampir race putting themselves second to the Moroi because of their role as their guardians BUT I FOUND IT FASCINATING. I can&#8217;t wait to rad more, find out more, find out if they will rebel, it&#8217;s just a truly fascinating dynamic!</p>
<p>I had a hard time with the emotional co-dependency between Rosa and Lissa. I understand that they have a connection and Rosa is Lissaâs protector and best friend but sometimes the things she would do or say just made me roll my eyes. Especially the way Rosa kept treating Lissa like a child who canât take care of herself. Luckily the book ultimately does a good job at addressing this (though not as much I as would have liked).</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: I really liked the vampire culture and world building, it was unique and new and I really enjoyed the fact that Mead stuck to the traditional sense of a vampire. The story was quite fresh to me as well, I havenât read a storyline like this before which really surprised me because I wasnât expecting it at all.</p>
<p>I do agree with Alix, it took a bit of getting used to Lissa and Roseâs relationship. Itâs a complicated concept that takes some time to digest and sit with you but I am intrigued and interested to see how Mead is going to explore their dynamic in the other books in the series.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: Iâm with the other ladies here &#8212; the world building was great. I loved all the politics and scheming. In the future I hope the author further explores the growing divide between the Moroi and their dhampir guardians, because it was touched on briefly that not all dhampirs are satisfied with being expected to just lay down their lives for their Moroi and are beginning to want more. I would also love to see the whole âMoroi fighting alongside their guardiansâ thing because that would be fabulous, thank you. Loved the snappy dialogue as well. But personally I wasnât a fan of the big reveal as far as who the villain was in the end, I thought it was fairly predictable and resolved a bit too quicklyâ¦ yes, there was a surprise in the final chapters but even that seemed over way too fast.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5dcead04-abdd-c445-38a2-d819cc036ff5" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Is there a love triangle? (dun dun dun!)</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: I didnât really feel that there were any actually present in the book, though there are plenty that could potentially arise later in the series. Now excuse me while I steal Lissa and Christian, hide them in my room, and attempt to save them from any possible love triangulationâ¦</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: Apparently Charlotte and I don&#8217;t have the same definitely of love triangle cause I say there isn&#8217;t really any! :P Thereâs plenty of set up of love triangles: Aaron/Lissa/Christian, Mason/Rosa/Dimitri but none of them end up playing out in the traditional YA kind of love triangle way. Thereâs definitely jealously and stuff but it all made sense to me and didnât annoy me. I would even argue that none of these are even real love triangles since at no point is either Lissa or Rosa trailing along 2 guys at once.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: Definitely two more prominent love triangles, might even be a love square in there but it was all handled quite well and I wasnât too bothered by it. Iâm looking forward to seeing how it pans out actually!</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5dcead04-abde-61c1-304d-b760d53a0bac" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vampire Academy is the first in a series, do you plan on continuing with it? Why?</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: I will! I liked the set up of the Vampire Academy world and I totally want to know if Rose and Dimitri are gonna hook up! I also loved the dynamic of the friendship between Lissa and Rose; it&#8217;s so nice to find a series that isn&#8217;t just about the romance! Also, YAY FOR A GOOD VAMPIRE SERIES!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: I think I will definitely go on with it. The first book set things up really well in my opinion and I do want to know more. I feel like Rose is a fantastic heroine right now, but that the trials and tribulations to come will only make her a better character for me. At least, I hope so. I also canât wait to see how things end up with Lissa &#8212; sheâs generally the quieter and more subdued personality, but I see sooooooo much potential for awesome in her and I have to see it happen!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: Absolutely, I like the characters and the world of Vampire Academy and I really want to see whatâs in store for Rose and Lissa particularly after the events at the end. Plus, more Rose and Dimitri wouldnât hurt :P</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Vampire Academy is soon to be released as a movie.Do you plan on going to see it?</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: Hmm&#8230; Iâm not sure. Iâm intrigued for sure. Iâve seen the previews and well, Iâm not sure if Iâm ready to let go of the Vampire Academy that exists in my brain in favour of the one Hollywood has created (because letâs be honest, who doesnât replace actors for characters of books once they saw the movie?!). Iâve also read in a couple of trusted blogs that readers of the whole series can tell from the trailer that a lot has been changed so&#8230; I donât know. Might be a Netflix/DVD situation for me.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: Ummmmm probably not? I havenât been all that impressed with the trailers so far and Iâd rather keep going with the books before I even start trying the film adaptation. I agree with Alix that Iâd like to keep clinging to what the story and characters are like in my imagination instead.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: Maybe not immediately, I guess I do intend to but I wonât be in a mad rush to watch it. <em>(Alix&#8217;s note: maybe we&#8217;ll do a #3PersonFilmClub for this eventually? ;)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> How did it compare to other vampire centred books youâve read?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: SO MUCH BETTER. Ok in all fairness, itâs not like Iâve read that many vampire books and the only one that comes to mind is Twilight, which&#8230;. PUKE. To avoid going into another Twilight rant during a Book Club post, but basically all the clichÃ©s and issues I had with Twilight didnât exist here. The only thing that came close was the weird emotional connection/co-dependency between Lissa and Rosa could be equated to a non-romantic version of Bella and whathisface but like, thatâs me stretching. There are no vegetarian vampires here, they feed off of humans and even though they are humans who have volunteered and are treated well, THEY STILL FEED OFF HUMAN BLOOD, which to me is awesome because if youâre gonna write about vampires, donât be apologetic of their behaviour!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: Waaaaayyyy better, reading VA gave me hope that apart from Twilight, there are good vampire books that actually stick to its roots and actually make vampires scary at least. It was so interesting to find that vampires in VA actually do have some powers, it really shakes things up. Iâm not quite sure if I like the idea of dhampir being the guardians of the Moroi and them completely devoting their lives to protecting the Moroi.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Paola</strong>: Ever so much better and a unique way to handle vampire culture; I thought she included a lot of bits and pieces of existing vampire lore and made them completely her own. Iâve been surprisingly lucky with my vampire books this year, what with how much I loved Coldest Girl In Coldtown by Holly Black, and of course my favorite vampire book ever is probably always going to be Robin McKinleyâs Sunshine, but Vampire Academy completely transcended my expectations. Slowly but surely, the Twilight trauma is beginning to fadeâ¦ soon it will only be a terrible memory hahaha</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Lastly, would you recommend this book?? How many stars would you rate it?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4057" alt="C" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/C.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Charlotte</strong>: 4.5 stars, I didnât absolutely love it as many people do but I felt it did live up to the hype and I really enjoyed reading it. The Vampire Academy world is definitely one which I would want to come back to and find out more. I feel so glad that it is very different from other vampire books and manages to hold its own.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4061" alt="new__A" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new__A.png" width="65" height="72" /></a>Alix</strong>: I give Vampire Academy a strong 3.5 stars. I think as the first book in a series, it did a wonderful job of building and explaining itâs world without it feeling like<br />
I also very much enjoyed the fact that the book is a self contained story. Yes it does set up a whole bunch of stuff that for the next book and yes some stuff isnât resolved but overall the story answered a whole bunch of questions and dealt with a contained story. If I didnât want to continue with the series, I would at least feel like Iâve read a complete story, which is much more than I can say for most series that are currently being published in YA (which is a rant for another day!).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4059" alt="new_P" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/new_P.png" width="65" height="72" /></a><strong>Paola</strong>:Â 4 stars from me! And I would recommend it to fellow jaded readers out there who want to experience vampires in a unique and not at all Twilight-ish way. Central to the story is the friendship and bond between Rose and Lissa, which is so refreshing because while there is romance in the book, itâs not the crux of the entire story.

We&#8217;re the duchesses, and we&#8217;re talking about the third and final installment of the <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10165761-quintana-of-charyn?ac=1" target="_blank"><strong>Quintana of Charyn by Melina Marchetta</strong></a>!

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Melina Marchetta</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">WARNING: SPOILERS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Only continue reading if you&#8217;ve already finished the book, please! #WhatNeedsToBeDone</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Spoiler-Free Option</strong></span>: scroll all the way down to the bottom of this post for our feelings translated into GIFS. You&#8217;re welcome.)</h3>
<p><span id="more-4014"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which characters have you gotten the most attached to over the course of the series, and why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Oh easy, EVERYONE. Â Well. Â If I canât say thatâ¦ I should say Beatriss and Trevanion because I love their story and they are wonderful characters, but honestly over the course of the whole series, the character that makes me the happiest because he changed so much is Froi. Â To have him start with nothing, to be so reviled in the beginning and just look at him in the end. Â Itâs the biggest character arc, and the fact that heâs conflicted over which country he belongs to, and how he honors the three women who mean the most to him is so touching. Â And that darkness in him thatâs just hovering &#8211; itâs interesting how he overcomes it step by step.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Lucien and Phaedra, they really started to grow on me when I was reading Froi of the Exiles and just seeing them together. Then in Quintana of Charyn they just utterly destroyed me, we only catch glimpses of Lucien and Phaedra which just makes me love them even more because the less Marchetta gives me of Lucien and Phaedra, the more I crave! But I also really loved Froi and Quintana, their relationship is unique and both are quite peculiar by themselves but they fit so well together like two puzzle pieces made for each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is Isaboe for me, hands down. I just love her. I love her even when sheâs not at her most loveable. Of course, Iâve felt this way about her since the first book, so no one should be surprised at my answer! Truthfully, I have a soft spot for just about everybody in this series. The most surprising thing for me was how much I ended up loving Froiâ¦ since all my attention was devoted to Finnikin and Evanjalin in the first book, he completely came out of nowhere for me in the second book; I didnât realize how much I would come to love him as a character and how complex he would end up being.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Lucian. He was just a Mont boy whose father died too abruptly that he had to grow up too fast, too soon and in such difficult conditions. Everyone was expecting him to be great and he was just under such tremendous stress. He was trying so hard to follow his head but his heart wouldnât and it was such a frustrating mess of emotions in him. He tried so damn hard to hide his feelings too that I canât help but gravitate towards both empathizing and sympathizing him. At one point, I just wanted everyone to GET OFF HIS BACK ALREADY, CANâT YOU SEE HEâS TRYING. Yup, too invested right there.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Did you have any predictions regarding events in the last book? Did any of those predictions come true?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I predicted it would be a happy ending in an emotionally satisfying way. Â I would absolutely never pick up these books again if the ending let me down and I didnât get a happy resolution!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: It was going to be a total emotional rollercoaster thatâs for sure and IT WAS. Just all my feels pouring out of me like pouring water out, at the end I was in a complete book hangover.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Yes, I predicted I would weep like a complete moron and I did. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: I read blind most of the time so I have barely any predictions. I did not expect an ending with such highly charged emotions though, I was being led falsely into believing it would be a heart-wrenching tragic ending. (Yes, me and my angst. Weeps.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">How did you feel about the ending??</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: That epilogue man!! It was snapshot after snapshot of the most gorgeously emotional scenes! Â Of love and happiness and hope and joy. Â I mean, it was just perfection!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END?? I mean it was so satisfying but I WANT MORE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: It was so, so, SO satisfying &#8212; I can recall few other books that have left me feeling so overwhelmingly content. I was laughing and crying for a thousand different reasons. I prefer to have closure when I finish a book and this definitely delivered on that. My only regret concerning this ending was the fact that it had to end at all. I just want it to keep going, on and on. Maybe Melina could tweet me random updates on the charactersâ lives?? âWell guys, Jasmina stole the mail again!â âGuess what? Little Tariq started walking today!!â et al etc. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Extremely satisfied. Hell, I think I was already satisfied when I read about Luci-en and Phaedra. (Is this too spoilery? Ahâ¦)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">DID YOU CRY???</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I cried throughout &#8211; little unexpected tearing up at all the moments when it looked like things might go wrong and suddenly went right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: I wanted to but the tears wouldnât come out lol. It was mainly all internal crying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: NOT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IN DEPTH CAUSE ITâS EMBARRASSING</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Iâ¦ didnât. I was more of YES EVERYONE LETâS CELEBRATE!!! THIS CALLS FOR THE MOST GRAND FEAST IN ALL OF CHARYN AND LUMATERE! (Polar opposites from Paola, lmao. STILL!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">What events in the book gave you the ultimate punch of feels?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion (Thatâs a popular one!) Isaboe losing her child and how Finnikin supported her through that. Â And later how the Monts tried to be happy when Isaboe came to visit so she can have their joy. Â Froi and Quintanaâs reunion for just a moment before they took her away. Â And also when Finnikin and Lord August want to adopt Froi so he can have a title. Â Oh and all the scenes in Chapters 1-49 with Epilogue.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion!!! Super tense and I was screaming from all the feels. Also that scene with Lucien and Phaedra (youâll probably know what Iâm talking about when you read it), THAT ONE LINE DESTROYED ME. Also the events at Charyn towards the end, I never saw it coming but it made me so happy!!!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Omgâ¦ what DIDNâT result in a feels facepunch here??? I think the top three moments that just completely did me in were: 1) when Froi thought he was going to die for sure and Finnikin appeared for the BEST BRO MOMENT EVER IN HISTORY; 2) when Froi and Quintana were reunited and I just kjahfkjhfkshdf DIED; 3) at the end when Finn, Froi and Lucian brought the story back full circle by vowing to be BFFs for life. Runner up: when Quintana opened the gift from Isaboe and it was that same ruby ring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">â¦ Okay, writing all that down just made my heart start aching all over again &gt;&lt;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Beatriss and Trevanionâs âNeed To Talkâ moment. Also, Perri and Tesadoraâs moment of breaking down as they talk about their past losses. Vestieâs meeting âKintanaâ. Lucian and Phaedraâs heated moment(s) of truth tops everything for me, complete with ~swiving~ and everything. There are so many but these are only some off the top of my head. :â)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which character(s) do you think went through the most growth in the series?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well Froi for me with how much he has gained from having friends and family and a purpose. Â And also Quintana &#8211; I was really touched by how much she cared for the girls who took care of her in her pregnancy when it seemed like they all could barely stand each other. Â It makes me hopeful about the people I canât stand in my life. LOL Â But seriously, Quintana is such a prickly character that seeing her opening up and having compassion just makes me want to cry for some reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Hmmm I want to say Froi but I think he did most of the growing back in the previous book. I think each and every character had a bit of growth here and there, there wasnât anyone in particular that grew the the most because most of the development happened in the previous two books. But if I really have to choose one I would say Phaedra, sheâs gone through a lot of change and really has grown quite a bit even in this book.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is a tie between Froi and Lucian for me. Froi just made these huge leaps and bounds in character development and all of it slapped me in the face in Book 2. How was this the same Froi??? And then Lucian! I thought he was going to be a minor character based on his minimal involvement with the first book but HOLY MOLY. From having to take over as leader of the Monts when his father died to the heart-crushing Lucian/Phaedra feels, he became so much more than I ever imagined.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Who the hell didnât grow in this series, sob. May I say Lucian again? For all the reasons heâs my favourite character in the first place. *weeps tears of rainbow*</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Journey Home: Week 2 Discussion</h2>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jay Kristoff</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy, Steampunk</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013; St. Martin&#8217;s Griffin</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: ARC from Publisher, 437 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/" target="_blank"><em>Stormdancer</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fate of Shima hangs in the balance, with the Imperium on the brink of civil war and people of all walks of life rising to answer the Stormdancer&#8217;s call. Yukiko and Buruu are living legends, carrying the rebellion&#8217;s hopes on their shoulders. But Yukiko, still reeling from grief and regret, must now also find a way to control her abilities before they do lasting damage. Fueled by rage, she leads the charge against the Lotus Guild and the failing Kazumitsu dynasty at the risk of completely losing herself in the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sequels this year are KILLING ME. SERIOUSLY. I mean, I&#8217;m sitting here right now staring at the screen, trying to figure out how to articulate the intense experience that was <em>Kinslayer</em> and just utterly failing. It&#8217;s hard to write a review when you&#8217;re sort of still peeling yourself off the floor and trying to salvage what&#8217;s left of your crushed heart. I thought <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/"><em>Stormdancer</em></a> was epic, heartbreaking, GLORIOUS &#8212; but its sequel somehow found a way to be all those things <em>and more</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3304"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book hits the ground running, and the action doesn&#8217;t stop until the very end. It&#8217;s a breathless, heart-stopping ride. When I read the first book earlier this year, I remember feeling initially overwhelmed by the author&#8217;s attention to detail; it was a lot to take in and process within those first hundred or so pages, and the one aspect of <em>Stormdancer</em> that bothered me. But with <em>Kinslayer</em>, that attention to detail becomes an incredible asset. This is an intense sensory experience that just consumes you. Everything, from the black depths of Yukiko&#8217;s grief to Shima&#8217;s bleak, broken landscape is rendered in such a powerful way that the colors seem twice as vivid and the emotions just leave you reeling. Jay Kristoff gets all my praise for this world he&#8217;s created and the characters that will ultimately decide its fate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of characters &#8212; Jay Kristoff, THANK YOU FOR MICHI. <em>From the bottom of my heart</em>. Yukiko and Buruu become even more amazing in this book (Buruu had me tearing up already only twenty pages in, I kid you not), but Michi absolutely stole the show for me. I think I need to add her to my list of spirit animals. I can&#8217;t even talk about her right now, I&#8217;m afraid of devolving into a useless, slushy pile of feels. I think this series is pretty remarkable for the amount of badass heroines stalking its pages. And what I love is that they&#8217;re badass in so many varied ways, displaying strength in so many different forms. Not all heroines prove their worth with swords. There is also strength in silence, in endurance despite pain, and sometimes words and secrets are more potent than any weapon you can hold in your hands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I feel like the second book in a series is a precarious place to be. It can be difficult to live up to the first book, as we see with so many unfortunate instances of Second Book Syndrome out there. I&#8217;m happy to report that Kinslayer takes the momentum of its predecessor and transcends every expectation. The plot gets even more complicated as war looms on the horizon, with the Lotus Guild desperately trying to salvage everything Yukiko destroyed even as the Kage Rebellion continue their efforts to save Shima from the poison within. I love that we get to see the rebellion from more than one side. The campaign to save Shima from itself involves more than simply spilling blood. This war is waged from multiple fronts &#8212; in the skies with Yukiko and Buruu, amid the towering trees of Shima&#8217;s last remaining forest, even in the opulent halls of the Imperial palace. Loyalties are tested and beliefs are questioned. You&#8217;re slapped in the face by one revelation after another, revelations that give some really mind-blowing answers to your questions, but also leave a trail of NEW questions in their wake.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As with any good sequel, I turned to the last page with this unshakeable sense that a storm is coming&#8230; and it&#8217;s going to be RIDICULOUS. It&#8217;s going to be the death of my feels. I couldn&#8217;t recommend this book, or this series, more. I&#8217;m upset that I have to wait so long for the next book, but also kind of relieved because 1) <em>Kinslayer</em> turned me into a flailing, sobbing train wreck and I need a considerable recovery period and 2) I have to brace myself for what&#8217;s ahead, and I have to start doing that now. Oh, by the way, <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte</a> and I have given the third book the tentative title ofÂ <em>Feelscrusher</em>. We feel that this is 100% appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you so much to the publisher for sending me an ARC of this book in exchange for my honest review. I am seriously overcome with gratitude because it was one of my most anticipated reads of the year and the series is such a favorite of mine.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-78e60601-dcbc-beea-999a-8bdd7d729ce5" style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coping.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-3506" alt="coping" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/coping-226x300.jpg" width="203" height="270" /></a>Few bookish experiences are more excruciating than the gap between one installment of a series and the next. Here you are, completely entangled in the assorted adventures and misadventures of a cast of characters youâve been following for quite possibly yearsâ¦ and now you have to WAIT.</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I meanâ¦ what???</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I know. Itâs painful, but we can do this. Here are some (tried and true) coping strategies for anyone currently stuck in that mystical limbo land between series release dates. Read through them, absorb their wisdom, and then come find me in my corner where Iâm sobbing like a moron and clutching my copy of <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167166-crown-of-midnight" target="_blank"><em>Crown of Midnight</em></a>, still crushed into a pulp by the intense feels. (I <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/crown-of-midnight/" target="_blank">reviewed it</a> earlier today &#8212; go see sordid evidence of the giant pulpy mess that is my heart right now.)</h3>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #1: Weep profusely and with abandon</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thatâs right, get all those tears out of your system. All you need for this exercise is you, your tear ducts, and ALL THE FEELS. Plus some frustration. Iâm sure you have these things. Curl up in your favorite self-pitying spot and cry until you canât cry anymore. Optional materials: a pint of Ben &amp; Jerryâs and/or your battered old teddy bear from the good old days when you still slept with a night light. (Or maybe you still sleep with a night light. I wonât judge.)</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3505"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #2: Go back to square one</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">By this, I mean read everything all over again, starting from the first book. You donât want to let go of these characters, right? Youâre not ready to put them away for the next few months or even a full year, are you??? Okay then. In all honesty, I like to do this if I can because I tend to blaze through the newest book in my rush to find out what happens. When I read it the second time, I can go slower and really pay attention instead of biting my nails and going, âEEEEKK!!!â every few paragraphs. Besides, now you know what happens. You can take it easy, maybe even come through with some deep thoughts. And maybe this time youâll take that massive facepunch to the feels with your shoulders thrown back and your feet squarely planted on the ground. Go on. Make me proud, tiger.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #3: Find a support group</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">No, really. Chances are, there will be others in the wide world of book lovers who feel the same way you do. Thatâs the beauty of this thing called book blogging (and the Internet in general). It used to be really hard for me to find someone who would understand the burning need to flail around and keysmash in all caps over a story, but now all I have to do is hit up Twitter or Goodreads. Case in point: I have an excellent #PostFinnikinSupportGroup. We help each other survive the crippling emotions caused by Melina Marchettaâs books, invent ridiculous hashtags together, and writhe in agony simultaneously when necessary.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #4: Make a soundtrack to go with your misery</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Then put it on infinite loop while you troll the Internet for fanart, fanfiction and all manner of ways to express the feelings churning through your broken heart. (These coping strategies sound alarmingly like post-breakup adviceâ¦ errâ¦) Many authors make playlists to go with their books, so use those as a starting point if you have to. There is something oddly therapeutic about driving home from work choking back sobs as you relive the epic highs and lows of the series through music. Itâs not pathetic, promise.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Strategy #5: Distract yourself with different reading material</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">No, youâre not cheating on your true love. Youâre just taking a break. Sure, itâs going to feel a lot like a love triangle, but you need some air. Take a vacation to another world, one populated with yet more characters who will steal your soul and keep it locked in a box by their bed. No one ever said you had to be exclusive. And then, when THAT series comes grinding to a halt while the next installment is still being written, you can move on again! I wonât tell. Just make eye contact with that book (or books) and say, âDonât hate the player, hate the game.â Or something equivalent. Then walk away with your head held high because they can smell fear. YOU ARE IN CONTROL HERE.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; There is a sixth hidden option, which is to be totally mature and just wait it out without the above hysterics taking place. Iâm not listing it because I donât really believe itâs possible.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;"><strong>Have a coping strategy to add to the list? Itâs important that you tell me. I have to document these things.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Cristin Terrill</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: September 3, 2013; Disney Hyperion</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC via Netgalley; 368 pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;You have to kill him.&#8221; Imprisoned in the heart of a secret military base, Em has nothing except the voice of the boy in the cell next door and the list of instructions she finds taped inside the drain.</p>
<p>Only Em can complete the final instruction. Sheâs tried everything to prevent the creation of a time machine that will tear the world apart. She holds the proof: a list she has never seen before, written in her own hand. Each failed attempt in the past has led her to the same terrible presentâimprisoned and tortured by a sadistic man called the doctor while war rages outside. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13514612-all-our-yesterdays" target="_blank">From Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This one has been getting rave reviews all over the place lately, and for good reason. From the first page, <em>All Our Yesterdays</em> pretty much grabs you by the wrist and pulls you into a tangled timeline of alternate futures. As Em and Finn desperately work to unravel the past that eventually plunged their future into darkness, I was left completely breathless by the pacing and plot. There&#8217;s not a moment to lose in their quest to prevent the worst from happening, which also means there isn&#8217;t a dull moment in the whole book. And that ending!! Ugh. I just really, highly recommend this book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3306"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, Em and Finn = ALL THE FEELS. I don&#8217;t even know where to begin. I loved these two together. I loved that their impossible mission and all the failed attempts they&#8217;d made only served to bring them closer together. They support one another, and when one falters the other swiftly stands up to shoulder the burden. I really appreciated the kind of relationship they had, but I also really liked them both separately too. Em is a tough girl who didn&#8217;t start out that way; you can see the kindness and compassion in her character in those moments when she hesitates to do what she set out to do. You&#8217;d think this kind of hesitation would be irritating, since every time Em can&#8217;t bring herself to pull the trigger is another missed chance to complete their mission. But I liked that she had a heart. I liked that she was unable to let go of the good memories, the good things about the past, despite the terrible things that made her into the person she is now. And um, let&#8217;s not start talking at length about Finn because I might babble forever. Suffice it to say that he&#8217;s the equivalent of a hand to hold when you&#8217;re afraid, reaching out at just the right second. It warmed my heart to see the way he was always able to remind Em that there was still hope left in the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What fascinates me about time travel books is all the cause and effect. I love tracing the steps that led to a certain outcome, which is something that <em>All Our Yesterdays</em> incorporates into its plot. As the story unfolds, more and more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. In a world where time travel is possible, time itself becomes fluid and changeable. Em and Finn try again and again, removing pieces and changing the past in an effort to find a path that leads to a different future. There are so many possibilities, so many scenarios. Each one subtly or drastically alters what that future looks like. So far, they haven&#8217;t been able to fix it so that the chain of events is disrupted. Every single time, no matter what element they take away or replace, the same fate is still waiting at the end. But they don&#8217;t give up &#8212; they just keep going, learning from each subsequent failure. It&#8217;s one of those stories that begins at the end. If you&#8217;re not a fan of shifting points of view or flashbacks, then you may not like the way All Our Yesterdays is told. To be honest, I had a pretty biased preference for Em&#8217;s chapters over Marina&#8217;s, but overall I&#8217;d say that the author handled switching between the two narrators really well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered shortly after finishing the book that it&#8217;s actually the first in a planned series, which admittedly made me kind of nervous. I went into it believing it was a standalone and was kind of upset by the concept of continuing the story after an ending that, while COMPLETELY HEARTBREAKING was also rather satisfying. I mean, after the severe facepunch to the feels that I received in the closing chapters, I found myself relieved when it was over because it ended on a hopeful note, with the promise of a happy ending. Now I&#8217;m fighting the urge to hide in a corner because I&#8217;m anticipating yet more twists and turns that will leave me sobbing all over again, haha! I&#8217;ve had some time to consider the whole sequel thing and I think I&#8217;m okay with it now. It was just a bit unsettling &#8212; like if you were on a crazy rollercoaster, finally coasted to a stop, then found out that NOPE the ride wasn&#8217;t actually over yet. GET BACK IN YOUR SEAT CAUSE WE&#8217;RE DOING THAT ALL OVER AGAIN, facepunches to the feels and all. I finally felt okay with this when I considered the fact that at least I would get to spend more time with <del>Finn</del> Em AND Finn&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>All Our Yesterdays</em> truly impressed me with characters that won my heart (and then broke it), a plot that bends time and delivers nonstop action, and the kind of feels-inducing moments that make a story unforgettable. You need to read this!! Ah, I&#8217;ve had such good luck with time travel books this year. If you liked this one, you may want to try out <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597706-the-loop" target="_blank"><em>The Loop</em></a> by Shandy Lawson as well &#8212; <a title="The Loop" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-loop/" target="_blank">my review is over here</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Disney Book Group for the ARC, which I received in exchange for my honest review. Be sure to watch out for <em>All Our Yesterdays</em>, which releases on September 10th!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Alexandra Bracken</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Disney Hyperion &#8211; eNovella, 85 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="The Darkest Minds" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-darkest-minds/" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America has been ravaged by an epidemic that robbed the population of its children and transformed the ones who managed to survive. This, combined with an economic crash, has left Gabe with very few options in life. His best chance of securing a future for himself is to become a skip tracer, hunting escaped children and teenagers who have broken out of the so-called reform camps. If he collects the bounties on their heads, he might just be able to save up enough to escape his troubled past. But when Gabe captures a young girl who can&#8217;t speak, he discovers that it&#8217;s even harder to just walk away. What if the government is wrong, and these children aren&#8217;t soulless or inhuman? What if giving this girl back to her captors would be the biggest mistake of Gabe&#8217;s life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely loved this novella! I&#8217;m a huge fan of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> (as some of you might have been able to surmise by now, considering how often I babble on and on about it) and I really feel like this short story is the perfect bridge between the first and second installments. Fans of Zu, rejoice! Masochistic readers who somehow enjoy being Facepunched By Feels, also rejoice! This one is a must-read if <em>The Darkest Minds</em> broke your heart into teeny tiny pieces, then tossed those pieces into a raging bonfire. Just&#8230; be ready for the pain. In fact, start bracing yourself now. RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3014"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I always really liked Zu in the first book, and running into her again in this novella was a lot like bumping into an old friend. And by bumping into an old friend, I mean finding her on the edge of a wilderness, pursued by ruthless bounty hunters. What I love about Zu here is that she&#8217;s a total scene stealer. We get to know her in a way that we weren&#8217;t able to in book one, because that centered mainly on Ruby. I really appreciated the added depth to Zu&#8217;s character &#8212; you don&#8217;t realize just how mature she is for her age until you meet her again in this story, and honestly I never noticed just how damn sassy the girl is! Even though Gabe is the one narrating, once Zu comes into the picture you really can&#8217;t help but be drawn to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ended up loving Gabe too, despite the fact that he comes off as a total douchebag in the beginning. There&#8217;s so much desperation in him, so much pain and bitterness, and I felt like he embodied all the displaced, hopeless people who were forced to live around the Kid-Killer epidemic and the failing economy. Desperation leads people to do terrible things, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they&#8217;re bad people. A huge theme in the series so far is survival, and there are many different ways to fight for that. Gabe&#8217;s method is to push his feelings and reservations aside in order to become a skip tracer, because he doesn&#8217;t know what else to do. I loved the transformation that took place when Gabe met Zu. I loved that Zu seemed to find this goodness inside Gabe that even he couldn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; AND THEN MY HEART ENDED UP IN SHREDS ON THE FLOOR AGAIN. Who didn&#8217;t see THAT coming??</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My warning to you: the e-novella may SAY that it&#8217;s 85 pages long, and it is, but that&#8217;s because it includes the first chapter of <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16150830-never-fade" target="_blank">Never Fade</a>, </em>which is out in October. So don&#8217;t end up like me and be totally, completely facepunched by the last chapter, which I didn&#8217;t think even WAS the last chapter. It seriously was like having a door slammed shut in my face. I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT AT ALL. Ugh. I have nothing else to say. I don&#8217;t want to spoil it for you. In fact, I think I&#8217;ll just go curl up in a corner now and continue the slow recovery process. *sniff* If you haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a> yet, GO DO IT NOW. (Hint: we&#8217;re giving it away as part of our birthday bonanza.) Need further convincing, or just want to see me walking around sobbing like an idiot? Read my review <a title="The Darkest Minds" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-darkest-minds/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Dawn Metcalf</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy/Paranormal</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: July 30, 2013 &#8211; Harlequin TEEN</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via NetGalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It begins on a crowded dance floor. Joy Malone sees a strange boy standing on the other side of the room&#8230; a boy no one else can see. She barely has time to react before he leaps across the space between them and tries to cut out her eye. An inauspicious way to meet someone for the first time, but it&#8217;s only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the increasing amount of problems that ensue over the next few days. Suddenly, Joy is being bombarded with cryptic messages and stalked by terrifying creatures. The hidden world of the Twixt is encroaching on her reality &#8212; a world where both love and revenge can be everlasting, and where some mistakes are impossible to erase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes I finish a book, set it down, and realize that I have absolutely no idea what I really thought of it. I end up being torn between two very strong, completely opposite emotions. Did I love it more than I hated it, or is it the other way around? Were the things I loved enough to outweigh the things that drove me crazy? Well, <em>Indelible</em> was one of those books. So I wrote down my notes before they could get away from me, and then I let these conflicted thoughts sort of untangle themselves over the next few days. Normally, this process works for me just fine. This time, it didn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m still torn, but I&#8217;m going to talk my way through this anyway, and maybe my observations will help you make up YOUR mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2631"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, <em>Indelible</em> is steeped in folklore. This is my favorite thing about the book, and its most redeeming quality. It&#8217;s rare to see this kind of approach to myths, legends and fairytales in the YA genre. No sparkly vampires here &#8212; the otherworldly denizens of the Twixt are the real deal. Beautiful and vicious, gruesome and yet irresistible, these creatures are the kind that lurk in the deepest shadows of those bedtime stories you loved as a child. (Think Guillermo del Toro.) I have to say that the world building provided an otherwise lackluster story with a lush, intriguing backdrop. I was enthralled with the Twixt and wanted more than anything to just dive right into it. I&#8217;ve always been a huge folklore/mythology nerd, so I really enjoyed this aspect of <em>Indelible</em>. It wasn&#8217;t just folklore from one culture, either. There was a lot of variety, which I also appreciated. Sometimes I found myself wishing the author would elaborate further on the creatures and strange Folk that Joy encountered over the course of the story just because I wanted to learn more about them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My relationship with Joy herself is pretty problematic, though. I like the fact that she didn&#8217;t waste much time twiddling her thumbs; that&#8217;s always a plus to me, because nothing is more irritating than watching a heroine vacillate between one course of action and another. When bizarre things start happening to her, Joy is proactive about trying to figure out what&#8217;s really going on. But then she went running right into the big YA pitfall: faceplanting into Instalove before I was even halfway through the book. I mean, it was already kind of bothering me that there were so many Twilight-ish parallels &#8212; not in terms of plot, necessarily (although there are similarities there as well), but in terms of scary repeating patterns of dependency and questionable choices being made. I hated that Joy was constantly being bailed out of trouble by the enigmatic Ink. All she had to do was say his name and he&#8217;d appear, ready to whisk her out of harm&#8217;s way. With Joy, it always seemed like she was being backed into corners and was ill-equipped to fight her way out of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of Ink, he was actually a surprise. A pleasant surprise, because I was expecting him to be surly and uncooperative, but he turned out to be the opposite. He was infinitely more interesting than Joy, and I really liked him, but even someone as charming and adorable as Ink isn&#8217;t justification for Instalove. Before I knew it, these two were dropping the L-bomb every which way. It felt like there wasn&#8217;t enough time at all for such a strong attachment to form between them, no matter how many absurd and dangerous situations they&#8217;d been forced in and out of over the course of a few weeks. Ink isn&#8217;t pushy, and he isn&#8217;t a jerk, but I couldn&#8217;t help being utterly turned off when Joy started abandoning her best friend, ignoring her dad, failing classes, and just generally becoming a space cadet orbiting her own life. Sound familiar?? That&#8217;s because these sordid details are part of the enduring horror story that takes place in so many YA novels, and it bugged me that it reared its ugly head here.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wavered between a 3 and a 3.5 rating for this, but in the end I have to give it a solid 3. I fell in love with the world of the Twixt and its bizarre menagerie of folklore-inspired creatures, and I really, REALLY wanted to give Ink a hug, but in the end I just can&#8217;t get over how quickly the protagonists decided they loved one another. It&#8217;s not that I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted them to end up together eventually&#8230; I just really would have felt better about the whole thing if they&#8217;d put on the brakes and maybe put that part off for at least the next installment, or even until the end of the series, after knowing each other longer. Still, I don&#8217;t think this flaw was a complete dealbreaker when you take the lush world building and high quality writing into consideration. I may still be on the fence regarding my feelings about this book, but that&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t give <em>Indelible</em> a try, especially if you love folklore and mythology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I received a digital ARC of <em>Indelible</em> courtesy of the publisher and Netgalley. No compensation was received for this honest review.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Susan Dennard</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical/Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, HarperTeen; eBook, 248 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleanor Fitt thought her family&#8217;s situation couldn&#8217;t get worse. Since her father&#8217;s death, money has been increasingly scarce, and now Eleanor&#8217;s brother has gone missing, with the only clue to his whereabouts appearing in the form of a letter crushed in the fist of an undead corpse. To make things worse, her mother unwittingly invited a malicious spirit into their home, she&#8217;s falling hard for an inventor of ill repute, and corsets make it extremely difficult to outmaneuver the undead horde. Land sakes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve heard so much about this series that picking it up was inevitable. I confess to knowing pretty much nothing about it when I requested from the library &#8212; only that it was mostly well received and had something to do with the undead. Guys, you don&#8217;t need very much convincing when it comes to this girl and a good zombie apocalypse. It&#8217;s a really interesting concept because there are, in my opinion, so many different ways to handle it. <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> brings the undead masses to 1876 Philadelphia, and while it was frequently predictable, I still thought it was a fun ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2814"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps that the heroine is easy to get along with. Eleanor Fitt is under a lot of pressure to help undo their formerly affluent family&#8217;s fall from grace. All she has to do is make a good match &#8212; which is easier said than done, because Eleanor happens to feel very strongly about being an independent woman during a time when girls and women were expected to remain resolutely in the background. It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, and Eleanor is having none of it. She has an insatiable mind, always brimming with curiosity, which of course gets her into twenty different kinds of trouble on a daily basis. It&#8217;s always nice to see a heroine who gets herself into scrapes but manages to get herself out of them, whether this means using her head or finding the nearest available baseball bat and taking out zombies with it. I liked Eleanor&#8217;s inquisitive nature and her determination to be something more than what society expected of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also thought it was interesting that there were so many mentions of body image. Early on in the story, Eleanor&#8217;s late father is quoted as having listed &#8216;a fondness for buttered toast&#8217; as one of her few vices. A lady is supposed to appear dainty and eat like a bird, plus there&#8217;s the problem of fitting into an extremely tight corset, so Eleanor is frequently hungry or even regretting taking an extra bite of breakfast. Her mother criticizes her figure, and Eleanor seems plenty aware that she isn&#8217;t the ideal size, but I appreciated that the concept was even included. I feel like it&#8217;s overlooked in other books of this genre; yes, the descriptions of beautiful dresses and tiny waists abound, but what about the problems associated with cultivating that image? To me, Eleanor was more down to earth because she struggled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the plot was predictable (I was able to guess most of the twists early on, as well as the big reveal), I didn&#8217;t feel especially bothered by it. First of all, I was intrigued by the concept of a zombie horde in the middle of 1876 Philadelphia and enjoyed the inclusion of the Centennial Exhibition as a central part of the story. The steampunk &amp; &#8216;scientific&#8217; paranormal bits were often a bit much and I ended up taking them with a grain of salt, but the author did a great job clearly defining the setting without overwhelming the reader with excessive period detail. It was sort of like&#8230; okay, I don&#8217;t really see how you could really rig an alarm to go off when the undead are near, BUT that&#8217;s fine because the characters are fun and the pacing keeps me from getting bored. (Kind of like those episodes of Ghost Adventures when they hold up some bogus piece of electromagnetic equipment and I just roll my eyes&#8230;) There&#8217;s a lot of action, with the first chapter opening with an undead attack, and there aren&#8217;t any dull moments acting as filler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, I liked Daniel immensely, but he totally punched me in the face with that ending. I mean, I don&#8217;t believe it for a second, but props to the author for choosing that moment in particular to NOT be predictable at all.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An incredibly readable book, <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> is an enjoyable excursion into an alternate Philadelphia where the dead aren&#8217;t always truly dead. A sassy heroine and a colorful supporting cast make the predictability more bearable. I&#8217;m happy to report that the conclusion of book one definitely has me excited for book two, although I can&#8217;t divulge much more than that without risking spoilers for you all. I&#8217;d say this one is one the lighter end when it comes to zombie books &#8212; if you&#8217;re looking for something really dark and full of feels, try <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8051458-the-reapers-are-the-angels" target="_blank"><em>The Reapers Are the Angels</em></a> by Alden Bell, or <a title="Warm Bodies" href="http://novelideareviews.com/warm-bodies/" target="_blank"><em>Warm Bodies</em></a> by Isaac Marion (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7619057-warm-bodies" target="_blank">book</a> AND <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588173/" target="_blank">movie</a>) for unexpected warmth and humor!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Kat Zhang</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins; eBook 343 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For longer than they can remember, Addie and Eva have been together. Just like everyone else in the world, they were born as two souls in one body, two completely different people with separate personalities and thoughts. But they soon discover that they aren&#8217;t like everyone else at all, because one of them should have receded during childhood, leaving the other in complete control. Eva, however, is still there &#8212; the ever-present voice in Addie&#8217;s head, unwilling to simply relinquish her hold on life. Her existence could be enough to get them killed, especially in a society where hybrids are viewed as a threat. When they discover that there is a chance for Eva to regain partial control, Addie and Eva are faced with a choice between the safety of being separate and the dangerous possibilities of staying together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took me an entire month to get through this book. Not because it&#8217;s long, or unreadable, but because it is so unbelievably slow. I swear it felt like nothing much happened between the first chapter and the last. I think I&#8217;m joining the minority by disliking this book as much as I did, but man. <em>I just did not get it.</em> The pacing moves at an absolute crawl, the protagonist(s) spend way too much time dithering over what to do next, and quite frankly I thought the world building was virtually nonexistent. I turned the last page and still felt unconvinced as to the necessity of persecuting, purging, and otherwise reviling &#8216;hybrids&#8217; other than a petty vendetta against people who are different. <em>What&#8217;s Left of Me</em> just didn&#8217;t work for this girl, unfortunately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2547"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the first few chapters, I was already looking for answers that weren&#8217;t being supplied. Other than a brief mention in the synopsis, it&#8217;s hard to be clear on just where all of this stuff is taking place. For the record, it&#8217;s apparently an alternate version of our world, with an alternate history in which everyone is born with two souls. One soul is dominant, the other recessive, and people who don&#8217;t end up losing their recessive soul are considered to be hybrids &#8212; extremely dangerous, and definitely not welcome in Addie and Eva&#8217;s alternate America. Here&#8217;s the thing, though: I have no idea why hybrids are supposedly so dangerous. They never seemed to have any unorthodox abilities, no telekinetic powers or superhuman strength, et al etc. In fact, the only clear advantage I saw in being hybrid was having double the brain power to get through algebra homework faster. (No joke, Addie and Eva actually provide an example of this in the book.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, case in point, if hybrids can&#8217;t really DO anything differently than non-hybrids&#8230; why on earth do we care if they live in our country or not?? <strong>Why exactly are they a threat??</strong> I mean, did I miss something&#8230;? It was made rather obvious that foreigners were NOT wanted because foreign hybrids started a terrible war that nearly wiped out all of humanity. Fine, hybrids made bad choices about nuclear warfare. But the war is over, and yet the government seems to be harboring this borderline childish grudge against hybrids. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an intended message here about how deeply society can fear and reject what they don&#8217;t understand, but I didn&#8217;t feel like it was executed well at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, back to the world building. Which is barely there at all. Like I said, I had no idea at first whether this was a post-apocalyptic version of OUR world or a world of the author&#8217;s fabrication. I had to go back to the synopsis and see that it was indeed an alternate. I personally disliked that I was being forced to grasp at straws here. I wish there had been more clues that this wasn&#8217;t a world based on ours, because I think I would have been less confused and more able to get into the setting right from the start. Of course, I may be the only one upset about this aspect. World building is pretty important to me though, and it&#8217;s hard to portray a dystopia in an alternate world when you only allow your reader a very shallow immersion in that world. It detracts from the atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Eva&#8217;s will to survive, and I applauded her conviction to stay with Addie rather than eventually vanishing the way recessive souls are supposed to. She had these flashes of brilliance during which she actually did things; Addie, on the other hand, seemed more recessive in nature than Eva. I&#8217;m not sure what the rules are for deciding which soul is dominant vs recessive, as yet again the world building kind of failed to elaborate on this, but I really questioned how Addie was dominant when she spent more time twiddling her thumbs, hesitating about what to do next, than Eva ever did. My only strong impressions of Addie were during the times she lashed out at Eva for A) wanting to be more than a voice in the back of her head (gasp, how atrocious) and B) wanting to kiss a boy that Addie wasn&#8217;t interested in. ??? ?? ????</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, I get the massive conflict that exists when you have two souls trapped in one body. That is actually a really intriguing idea to ponder. I get that it&#8217;s terrible never having private thoughts, never just getting to be you, because you have two personalities. In the end, it&#8217;s hard for either of them to be happy. I just wish this internal conflict had been paired with a plot that was more compelling and a setting that was more defined. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m all for thought-provoking books and having to dig a little deeper to find the meaning of a story, but despite trying really hard to get something out of this experience, I&#8217;m sad to say I walked away pretty disappointed. Another case of having an awesome premise but falling short in the execution, in my opinion.</p>
