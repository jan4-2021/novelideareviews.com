				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Mindy McGinnis</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Dystopian</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013, Katherine Tegen Books</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 320 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RELATED POST</strong>: <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days Tour Recap</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a world where fresh water is rare enough to kill for, Lynn and her mother spend their days on the roof of their house. The focus of every day is defending the pond on their property, which is their main source of water, and which is consequently a prime target for others who are desperate to survive. Life is a battle for Lynn, and it only intensifies when shots in the dark and smoke on the horizon signal both a beginning and an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, this book would&#8217;ve flown under my radar if not for my good friend <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte at Gypsy Reviews</a>, who told me I needed to pick it up while I was at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/"><strong>Dark Days Tour</strong></a> signing last month! So thanks for the recommendation, Charlotte!! I was lucky enough to meet author Mindy McGinnis during the event &#8212; she signed my book (<a href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/photo_2-2/" target="_blank">and tore the title page</a>, but she drew a smiley face next to it so all was well in the end! haha) and also signed a bookmark for me to give away! <strong>Details on how to win are at the end of this post :)</strong> And be sure to read <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">my recap of the Dark Days Tour</a> stop in Vegas for what Mindy had to say about her debut novel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3911"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> is pretty stark on the surface &#8212; Lynn and her mother are fighting for survival in a bleak, dystopian society. I know a lot of us have had enough of dystopia in YA these days, but I have to say that this one stands out from the crowd. Not only is the survival aspect very realistic and believable, it&#8217;s also infused with an undercurrent of hope and the possibility of change for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that it was such a no-frills narrative. The writing is readable but not so simplistic that it detracts from the emotional content. You really get a feel for the kind of life Lynn leads, which is not forgiving or easy at all. The environment is harsh, riddled with dangers that need to be guarded against at all times. From a very young age, she&#8217;s been forced to sink or swim. Sometimes when I read dystopia, it&#8217;s really hard to get into the atmosphere because too many frivolous things litter the story &#8212; love triangles, insta-love, extraneous drama &#8212; all the usual suspects that make it seem like they&#8217;re too busy being emo to actually get to the business of surviving. This isn&#8217;t the case with <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>. Every minute of every day is precious, and every day in itself is hard won.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist, Lynn, has never known a world that didn&#8217;t demand this kind of struggle. She&#8217;s been raised by her mother, learning to grow a thick skin and move through life without hesitating to kill if that&#8217;s what it takes to survive another day. They defend their pond against man and beast &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter who. And because she&#8217;s been raised to trust no one but her mother, Lynn is a character that sometimes displays a really callous personality. It kind of bothered me at times just how unfeeling she could be, but it&#8217;s worthwhile to remember that this is all she&#8217;s ever been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until events cause massive change in her life, Lynn is resistant to any type of change at all and even more resistant when it comes to depending on other people. She&#8217;s wary of going beyond the small circle of her comfort zone, and the crazy thing here is that what&#8217;s &#8220;comfortable&#8221; for Lynn would probably be SUPER uncomfortable for a big baby like me, haha. The good thing is that she undergoes this massive amount of growth by the time the story ends. She&#8217;s still tough as nails, and she still has a very black and white, straight up survivalist outlook on life, but her heart becomes more open. She experiences love and friendship that temper her previous experiences of loss and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a romance in this book, but it&#8217;s pretty low key. The highlight of the story is Lynn&#8217;s relationship with a little girl named Lucy who teaches her both how to care for another person and how to be cared for in return. I really appreciated this aspect of the story, as well as Lynn&#8217;s growing acceptance and eventual friendship with her neighbor, Stebbs. Overall, what makes this novel is not the stark reality of a world without fresh water and what that means; instead, it&#8217;s about fighting for the people you love.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a solid standalone novel and one that I recommend for anyone looking for a true survival story &#8212; the author knows her stuff! As she mentioned during the Dark Days event, her actual lifestyle is very similar to Lynn&#8217;s! (Not because she shoots people from her roof if they come near her pond&#8230; haha!)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Simone Elkeles</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: October 1st 2013; Walker Children&#8217;s Books (Bloomsbury USA Children&#8217;s Books)</p>
<p><em><strong>SERIES:</strong></em><strong>Â </strong><em>Wild Cards #1</em></p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After getting kicked out of boarding school, bad boy Derek Fitzpatrick has no choice but to live with his ditzy stepmother while his military dad is deployed. Things quickly go from bad to worse when he finds out she plans to move them back to her childhood home in Illinois. Derekâs counting the days before he can be on his own, and the last thing he needs is to get involved with someone elseâs family drama.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ashtyn Parker knows one thing for certain&#8211;people you care about leave without a backward glance. A football scholarship would finally give her the chance to leave. So she pours everything into winning a state championship, until her boyfriend and star quarterback betrays them all by joining their rival team. Ashtyn needs a new game plan, but it requires trusting Derekâsomeone she barely knows, someone born to break the rules. Is she willing to put her heart on the line to try and win it all? (from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13065327-wild-cards" target="_blank">GoodReads)</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From some reason I&#8217;ve been on a sport theme book kick recently. I don&#8217;t know why since I&#8217;m not a sports person (I don&#8217;t follow any sports per say and only watch the occasional hockey game here and there) yet this is the 3rd book centre around a sports player I&#8217;ve read in as many months!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Derek is your classic good boy gone bad. He was a star athlete and great son until the death of his mom, which results in him choosing to basically not care about anything anymore. Now living with his ditzy mother and having issues with his absentee dad (who&#8217;s in the Navy), Derek&#8217;s life is turned upside again when a school prank leads to his expulsion and move to a suburb of Illinois. Ashtyn on the other hand, is the classic good girl with major issues. Her mom abandoned her family when she was a kid and subsequently her older sister Brandi (Derek&#8217;s stepmom), also. Finding herself living with only her father, who is stuck in his own bitter world, Ashtyn has found joy in playing on her high school&#8217;s football team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The characters were very much classic clichÃ©s: Derek the bad body, Ashtyn the good girl, Landon the asshole boyfriend, Brandi the ditzy stepmom and Gus the bitter absentee father. I wish the story had pushed these characters to have more depth and complexities. There&#8217;s nothing necessarily wrong with characters that have clichÃ©s traits but for me, it made them lack originality and depth. I wanted to know more about Brandi and what led to her leaving her sister and father behind. How did she meet Derek&#8217;s dad? I wanted more about Derek&#8217;s dad as well. I liked the peek we got in Derek&#8217;s parents romance but it wouldn&#8217;t have been nice to get more depth in how their moving around affected Derek. There was plenty of missed potential there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I did like was that Ashtyn is a female football player! That was definitely original and I love how she was already a fully integrated member of her HS team. There wasn&#8217;t any issues with her male teammates and I loved how they had her back and stuck up for her. The dynamic of her and teammates as well as her being a football player were all parts of the story I really liked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3620"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story really lagged for me. The bulk of the book was so slow moving and very predictable. Of course Derek and Ashtyn clash. Of course Ashtyn&#8217;s boyfriend is a jerk (I also saw the twist about him coming a mile away). Everything was just a set up to Derek and Ashtyn yet it was so slow and repetitive, I made me not as interested in them as I could have been. Speaking of which:Â HOW IS THE FACT THAT THEY ARE STEP SIBLINGS NOT REALLY AN ISSUE FOR ANYONE?! Not their families or friends or any other character for that matter bring up the fact that Derek and Ashtyn are related as ever being weird or you know, could make their relationship THAT MORE COMPLICATED. But nope! Seriously, the fact that they are step-aunt and step-nephews was really just an &#8220;easy&#8221; way of having them live together and be forced to meet/interact. I really wish the story had addressed this. I was fine with the romance between them, after all they aren&#8217;t related. But one of the things that made me pick up the book was my curiosity of how they would deal with technically being related. I was so disappointed that this ended up pretty much being swept under the rug.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story becomes rushed for the last 50 pages are so. Derek&#8217;s goes to see his Grandmother, who starts off as a manipulative, judgemental character who suddenly does a 180. I wish there had been more character development here cause it came off super quick and out-of-character to me to see Derek not only bend to his Grandmother&#8217;s will so easily (after being told it&#8217;s what his &#8220;mother would have wanted&#8221;) and on the flip side, &#8220;Grams&#8221; uprooting her whole life and being OK with Derek/Ashtyn out of, what felt like, nowhere. Derek and his Grandmother&#8217;s relationship could have worked but it was just too rushed to make sense to me.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Wild Cards</em>Â is a book with great potential but for me, it ended up being problematic. The premise of a female football player, who is ambitious and unapologetic about her love of the playing the game and life goals is great and was by far my favourite about the book but it wasn&#8217;t enough to make it work as a whole.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to Bloomsbury USA Children&#8217;s Books from providing us with an ARC via Netgalley!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Holly Black</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Paranormal/Urban Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013; Little, Brown BFYR</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Â Tana lives in a world where walled cities called Coldtowns exist. In them, quarantined monsters and humans mingle in a decadently bloody mix of predator and prey. The only problem is, once you pass through Coldtownâs gates, you can never leave.</p>
<p>One morning, after a perfectly ordinary party, Tana wakes up surrounded by corpses. The only other survivors of this massacre are her exasperatingly endearing ex-boyfriend, infected and on the edge, and a mysterious boy burdened with a terrible secret. Shaken and determined, Tana enters a race against the clock to save the three of them the only way she knows how: by going straight to the wicked, opulent heart of Coldtown itself.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been such a long time since I read a vampire book I enjoyed this much &#8212; I was well and truly impressed with the gritty and yet oddly glamorous world of Holly Black&#8217;s vampires and the humans who co-exist with them. I loved that the story was full of both beauty and blood. I loved the entire pop culture phenomenon she created around vampirism. I loved her heroine. I JUST LOVED IT OKAY.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing about the world we see in this novel is that it&#8217;s so very believable, especially when you consider modern culture and the things society values and finds entertaining right now, as we speak. Holly Black&#8217;s vampires are relegated to Coldtowns, where they are walled away from the rest of the population but still the center of a universe that is inexorably drawn to their allure. Magnetic, fascinating, and infinitely dangerous, they are both feared and yet hopelessly admired. It was crazy seeing vampirism from this angle. There are vampire tourist traps, vampire blogs, vampire hunter shows littered with crossbows and imagery that ranges from the grotesquely fascinating to just plain grotesque.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3305"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Immortal, the vampires celebrate a night that never ends, which in turn is accessible to anyone with cable. This atmosphere was conveyed with masterful execution that gave the reader insight into a lot of different perspectives, from the blogger obsessed with being immortal to the rest of the population that lives outside all of that glory and gore, still striving to live the most normal lives possible in the wake of a vampirism epidemic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This vividly rendered world would be pointless without the right kind of heroine, and I&#8217;m happy to say that Tana is absolutely right for her role. I loved that she was so determined to hang on to who she was, even when it would have been easier to give in and let go of every shred of humanity she possessed. She&#8217;s a fighter in so many ways. I liked her attitude, her practical acceptance that in order to get through this ordeal she would have to do things that would not only hurt her, but possibly hurt others as well. I guess I just like that kind of personality in my heroines. When you&#8217;re faced with a terrible situation, do you panic and fall apart, or do you get a grip and keep moving on? Tana chooses the latter. A lot of shit goes down, but she sticks to her ideals and what&#8217;s important to her. I can&#8217;t help but respect that in a character.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mean, Tana manages to stay true to herself even with GAVRIEL to deal with. Guys, we can&#8217;t talk about him, okay? Because I will start screaming and flailing and just turn into a pile of slush. Here is a complex character in every sense of the word. We never know what&#8217;s going on with him. We&#8217;re never entirely sure where his allegiance lies. He proves to be both unpredictable and slightly deranged, but it&#8217;s somehow perfect. The attraction between these two is ridiculous and heart-stopping and again, somehow perfect. I have to say that Gavriel is one of my favorite leading men (and vampires) ever.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolutely loved it. And it&#8217;s not part of a series, but this is one of those rare occasions when I kind of found myself wishing it was a series, because I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of the world and the characters (and Gavriel, ahem) in only one book. That being said, I also love that it was a standalone in a genre dominated by series. You get closure, even if you don&#8217;t get to have more delicious vampire men. /sigh/ Oh, fine. Anyway, highly recommended &#8212; definitely the best vampire book I&#8217;ve read since Robin McKinley&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8088.Sunshine?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sunshine</em></a>, which is saying something when you consider that <em>Sunshine</em> happens to be <a title="#26: SUNSHINE" href="http://novelideareviews.com/26-sunshine/" target="_blank">one of my favorite books of all time</a> AND combines the immortal undead with tons of cinnamon rolls. I mean, could you get a higher recommendation from me based on this??? No. <strong>So go get this book!!</strong> (And <em>Sunshine</em> too, okay??)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">Colette Iselin is excited to go to Paris on a class trip. Sheâll get to soak up the beauty and culture, and maybe even learn something about her familyâs French roots.</span></p>
<p>But a series of gruesome murders are taking place across the city, putting everyone on edge. And as she tours museums and palaces, Colette keeps seeing a strange vision: a pale woman in a ball gown and powdered wig, who looks suspiciously like Marie Antoinette.</p>
<p>Colette knows her popular, status-obsessed friends wonât believe her, so she seeks out the help of a charming French boy. Together, they uncover a shocking secret involving a dark, hidden history. When Colette realizes she herself may hold the key to the mystery, her own life is suddenly in danger . . .</p>
<p>Acclaimed author Katie Alender brings heart-stopping suspense to this story of revenge, betrayal, intrigue â and one killer queen.Â (from <a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16139598-marie-antoinette-serial-killer" target="_blank">GoodReads</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">)</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Before I get into the story, can we take a moment to talk about the cover? This was another case of attractive cover pulling in me. IÂ <em>love</em> it!</p>
<p><i>Marie Antoinette, Serial Killer</i> was a fun read for me. I ended up reading most of the book in one sitting, which is always a good sign! The storyÂ is centred around Colette, a American teenage student going to Paris for the first time. Colette started off to me as being a rich bitch. The way she treated her brother and mother, the sense of extreme teenager emoness resulting from her parent&#8217;s divorce and resulting less comfortable financial situation made me wonder how I was going to be able to get through the book. Hannah and Pilar, Colette&#8217;s rich BFFs were also quite insufferable. Basically think poor man&#8217;s mean girls. Hannah I really disliked. She was very disagreeable and not even in a enjoyable way. I was kind of hoping she would be one of the victims&#8230; Luckily about half way through the book (coincidentally when I found myself reading the rest of it in one sitting), Colette goes through character development that made her much more sympathetic to me. Once she finally starts to change and realize that being a &#8220;mean girl&#8221; isn&#8217;t what it&#8217;s all cracked up to be, I definitely liked her a lot more. I also have to say that I did understand why she wanted to badly to be in with Hannah and Pilar. I think the reality is that most of us, given the opportunity in high school, would most likely chose to hang out with the rich, popular girls if it made the HS more &#8220;easy&#8221;. I would have liked more time to spent on her character development how realizing it might appear to be easier to be a mean girl, it isn&#8217;t all that it&#8217;s cracked up to be and not the person she wanted to be.</p>
<p><span id="more-3690"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been to Paris but still I felt like I could picture all the places Colette visited. The Catacombs were claustrophobic, the descriptions of the Eiffel Tower at night made easily picture and overall I just felt like the book did a good job of bringing Colette&#8217;s Paris to life.</p>
<p>I really liked Colette exploring the mystery meaning of the symbol on an old pendant she found in a box from her French grandmother that she keeps seeing all over Paris. I though the discovery of what it meant and how it worked with the serial killer mystery was really interesting. I wish there had been more about that and devilling into the her family&#8217;s past and connection to Marie Antoinette. I also enjoyed the whole ghost serial killer story. I found it was fun to have a few pages told from the perspective of the characters who are about to murdered. It attended more intrigued and mystery to the story to me and made me want to keep reading.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a small romance in the story between Colette and their teenage tour guide. It wasn&#8217;t anything special truth be told. I wasn&#8217;t like ~swoon! over them. It was cute but honestly, if there hadn&#8217;t been a romance, it wouldn&#8217;t changed anything really for me.</p>
<p>The biggest issue I had with the book was just how quickly the whole &#8220;murdering ghost on a revenge path&#8221; plot was resolved. I don&#8217;t want to spoil it without getting too much into it but I really liked the build up to the climax and then boom! it&#8217;s over. It was just way too easy and quick for me and didn&#8217;t live up to what the rest of the book built up. The book is relatively short and I feel like the way this plot line was resolved is a result of that, much Â like not enough time being spent on Colette&#8217;s character development.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Marie Antoinette</em><em>, Serial Killer</em> was a quick and fun read. I really enjoyed Colette&#8217;s Paris and found the serial killer plot line, despite it&#8217;s ultimate pitfall, interesting.<em><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A big thank you to Scholastic for providing us with an ARC via NetGalley in exchange of an honest review!</p>

<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sherry Thomas</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013 &#8211; Balzer + Bray</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Prince Titus has known for years that his fate is to find and protect the next great elemental mage of his generation. He&#8217;s been preparing for every eventuality, rightly anticipating that this task will be far from easy. Such a powerful mage would be ruthlessly hunted, especially because a prophecy exists that says they will be the savior of the Realm &#8212; the one to finally end the tyrannical rule of the Bane, who currently controls even Prince Titus with an iron fist. But a complication of epic proportions arises when Titus finally crosses paths with this prophesied hero&#8230; and things turn out to be nothing like he expected.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am so stupidly in love with this book that I can&#8217;t stop the crazy urge to giggle and flail around as I write my review. I&#8217;m sure you all know that while I read other genres too, my heart belongs with Fantasy and I feel most at home when adventuring through the countryside in search of dragons to vanquish. (Would I be any good at actually vanquishing dragons in real life? No. That would be a disaster. Also it is beside the point~) <em>The Burning Sky</em> contains clever characters, fascinating magic, harrowing political schemes, adorable boys in school uniforms, and a feels-inducing romance. In short, I WANTED FOR NOTHING.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3770"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First we need to talk about this book&#8217;s dynamic duo. Iolanthe Seabourne is a rare elemental mage, capable of controlling three of the four elements in a time when most others like her are only barely able to command one. While her guardian sinks ever deeper into a slump that has lasted for decades, she is forced to be the responsible one in the household. This is difficult enough without the added problem of suddenly being chased by other mages who want to capture and exploit her powers. Also chasing Iolanthe is Prince Titus, whose mother predicted he would meet the next great elemental mage and that his destiny was to protect her at all cost. Guys, THESE TWO. They are such a power couple in every sense of the word. I loved their relationship through all of its ups and downs. The best thing about it was that Iolanthe and Titus are more than a match for one another. They&#8217;re both intelligent, cunning, and resourceful, and they balance each other so well. Titus is the sort of person to be perennially prepared for everything, and Iolanthe manages to keep him on his toes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, I&#8217;m pretty sure Titus is now one of my top ten favorite male leads of all time. I will NOT start talking about why because this review will then go on forever. Suffice it to say that I love him desperately. I think I knew it was true love even before he boarded his private train car while carrying a pet canary named Miss Buttercup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a plot that moves at a lightning pace. There was never a dull moment for me. It&#8217;s also filled with humorous moments as Prince Titus labors to hide Iolanthe at none other than Eton College, a lone girl among hordes of schoolboys. If you&#8217;re wondering why Eton and England in general make an appearance in the book, it&#8217;s because <em>The Burning Sky</em> features a universe where there are multiple worlds, some magical and some not. Ours is not a magical world here, but it does have a significant population of exiles from realms that do have magic. But you shouldn&#8217;t be worrying about that because it&#8217;s more fun to follow our hero and heroine from one misadventure to another. I really enjoyed the mix of funny banter and constant danger. Such things make me happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#8217;s plenty of action and excellent world building going on here. I also loved the atmosphere of secrets and subterfuge, and the fact that everyone had an agenda. I did see shades of Harry Potter going on, a comparison that is probably difficult to avoid when reading anything that involves magic and boarding school. But I really feel like Sherry Thomas created a world (well, worlds) that are entirely her own. As a fan of everything fantasy, I always love to encounter new concepts and twists on ideas that have been around for a while and in that sense I think this book delivered without question. The only thing that I found myself feeling a bit conflicted about was how varied and I guess practically limitless the magic system was &#8212; there wasn&#8217;t much that magic couldn&#8217;t do for you, from tailoring your clothes (admittedly I would find this very useful) to transforming yourself into a bird. I think it could have had a few more limitations to make it seem more believable&#8230; but this really didn&#8217;t stop me from having the time of my life while reading.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite books of the year, without a doubt. <em>The Burning Sky</em> was an incredible ride and is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy as much as I do. Stay tuned later today for my recap of the Dark Days Tour stop here in Las Vegas, which will involve me running around shrieking and sobbing with joy at getting to meet Sherry Thomas in person!</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">The world is living in the shadow of oncoming disaster. An asteroid is set to strike the earth in just one weekâs time; catastrophe is unavoidable. The question isnât how to save the worldâthe question is, what to do with the time that&#8217;s left? Against this stark backdrop, three island teens wrestle with intertwining stories of love, friendship and familyâall with the ultimate stakes at hand.Â Â (from </span><a style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332270-tumble-fall" target="_blank">GoodReads</a><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was attracted to this title because its pretty cover and catching summary. I love stories sent against an on-coming/occurring apocalypse (I have watched <em>The Day After TomorrowÂ </em>an almost embarrassing number of times)Â soÂ <em>Tumble &amp; FallÂ </em>seemed right up my alley!</p>
<p>The story follows 3 teens living in Martha&#8217;s Vineyard who are each dealing with heavy emotional baggage in the wake of an asteroid about to hit Earth. Sienna, who is a &#8220;summer resident&#8221;, has just been taken out of a hospice by her dad where she was being treated for mental issues. Her father brings her to their summer home in the Vineyard, which they haven&#8217;t been to since her mother&#8217;s death years before, in hopes of making their possibly final days there happy. Once there, Sienna happily reunites with her younger brother but is shocked to find out that her father not only has a girlfriend but they plan to marry before the asteroid hits. Zan is an island native who has been struggling with the untimely death of her boyfriend over one year ago. As the end nears, Zan discovers that he might not have been the man she thought he was and start to question the premise of their relationship. Caden, another island native, comes from a broken home with an alcoholic mother and father who walked on them when he was a kid and never came back. Until now. Caden finds himself kidnaped by his father and forced to finally deal with his issues regarding his father and family.</p>
<p>I liked the premise of 3 separate story lines told by 3 different characters. I felt that while the characters weren&#8217;t connected beyond living their possibly final days in the same community, the 3 stories still related to each other since they were all dealing in one way or another with the same issues: abandonment and family.</p>
<p><span id="more-3618"></span>I struggled with the selfishness of the Sienna and Zan. I understand that as teenagers they would put love in front of family but it was never completely justified in a way that felt right with me. Sienna basically falls in love and abandons her family within a couple of days and Zan, despite what might be the end of the world fast approaching, cannot see beyond her broken heart to be with her family (I&#8217;m being a little harsh here since the character arcs does that these characters come to their senses eventually but it was all a little too late to me). That feeling of not completely understanding or being able to relate to the characters was something I struggled with for the whole book.</p>
<p>I thought Sienna was the most interesting character out of the 3 teens because she was the one who was the most broken (yes I also really like broken characters). I understood the motivation behind her actions the most because I felt like we got the most progression out of her inner monologued instead of the same repetition of things with Zan and Caden. I didn&#8217;t agree with her just abandoning her father and brother for some random guy she&#8217;s apparently in love with. But the story did a good job of explaining the issues she struggles with, being afraid of failing her father and brother, pushing them away and her fear of the depression she suffers from taking ahold of her in the same way it did her mother, that pushed her towards making that choice and then her subsequent ones that lead up to the end of her story.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like some of the choices that were made with Caden story. I know Caden&#8217;s father is meant to be portrayed as centred, controlling, a-hole but I really didn&#8217;t understand why he suddenly orders a prostitute to take his son&#8217;s virginity! Like seriously? WHY. How does he even know Caden is a virgin?!?! Just all of that encounter and resulting inner narration by Caden confrontation with his dad felt awkward and off in a really bad way. I understand that there needed to be something that happens to have Caden decide once and for all to cut ties with his add but I found the introduction of this virgin/prostitute storyline jarring and unnecessary. I really wish the author had made a different choice here. Oh and I also could have lived with Caden&#8217;s crush on his kinda-step-mother and everything that happened with her. It was a total clichÃ© if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Zan I found to be&#8230; boring. I never connected to her story. I thought she was whiny. I found the story about her half-sister to be way more interesting then her dead boyfriend&#8217;s but it took a back burner. I don&#8217;t really have much more to say about her. I also had a hard believing that it would be that easy for Zan to travel to Boston and back within that short of timeframe considering the oncoming asteroid.</p>
<p>My biggest issue with the book was that while it was character driven, the characters didn&#8217;t drive enough the story to make it captivating for me. I kept reading the book mostly because I still loved the premise and kept waiting be enthralled, for more to happen, to have one of the stories jump out at me. Yet it never happened. It eventually started to feel boring. There was a slowness to the pacing that didn&#8217;t work to me and while there was somewhat sense of oncoming doom, I didn&#8217;t find it prominent enough considering. I wanted to have that sense of the world might be about to end but unless one of the characters mentioned it or talked about the presidential speeches, I forgot more then once the larger context of the book.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Tumble &amp; Fall</em> was just an okay read for me. I was left feeling unsatisfied by the lack of captivating characters and the end didn&#8217;t work for me. The book had great potential and I don&#8217;t regret reading it. It just unfortunately not ended up being a memorable read.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you toÂ Macmillan Children&#8217;s Publishing Group and NetGalley for providing an ARC in exchange of an honest review.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Stacey Jay</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 256 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The domed city of Yuan is the only safe haven for miles in the harsh deserts of Isra&#8217;s dying planet. The lands outside the dome are prowled by the Monstrous &#8212; mutated beasts like Gem. They were once human, and are now shunned from the cities where those without mutations dwell in privilege and even luxury. Their safety comes at a terrible price, however; a price that Isra knows too well. The blind princess of Yuan keeps many secrets, not all of which are her own. Her path collides with Gem&#8217;s when the starving Monstrous attempt to steal the source of Yuan&#8217;s prosperity and fail. What unfolds is a friendship, and then a love, that could change the fate of their world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a huge fan of fairytales and an even bigger fan of fairytale retellings, especially creative ones. I&#8217;ve read quite a few of these over the years, but I have to say that <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> is by far the most unique version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. And you know, sometimes I just get this gut feeling about a book&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to explain, but some books I just KNOW I&#8217;m going to love. I read the synopsis and DONE, let me have it RIGHT NOW. This was one of those inexplicable moments of book serendipity for me. (I mean, just read the synopsis&#8230; OF COURSE THIS WAS MEANT FOR ME. Hello???)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3300"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to being the most unique <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> retelling I&#8217;ve ever come across, <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> also holds the record for creepiest use of that fairytale&#8217;s rose motif. Seriously. I challenge you to find creepier roses than the ones in this book. It was only one of the many creative twists the author implemented. In fact, the world building and storyline are so well developed that the original fairytale is more like the bone structure underneath, giving the plot its shape but not constricting it. I&#8217;ve found over time that this is my favorite kind of retelling, because you can still trace it back to its fairytale roots, but it can also stand alone as something entirely unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought Isra in particular was a fantastic piece of character development all around. With every revelation, every little piece of her world that turns out to be a lie, she loses her footing but rallies and goes two steps further than she did before. This girl&#8217;s a fighter. Despite being born within the Dome and not having to deal with the unforgiving environs of the desert outside, despite never wanting for food or shelter, Isra is still at quite a disadvantage in the beginning of the story. For one thing, she&#8217;s been blind since childhood, which makes the lies that imprison her all the more difficult to detect. But as the story progresses, and as she forms a bond with Gem and begins to question everything she&#8217;s been forced to accept, Isra just gets tougher and tougher. She&#8217;s determined to deal with things in her own way, with this inherent bossiness that perfectly suits her, but also a deep compassion and empathy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually it&#8217;s the Beast that holds Beauty captive, but in this story it&#8217;s the other way around. When Gem and his fellow Monstrous are caught trying to steal the roses that are the heart of Yuan&#8217;s magic, Isra orders her guards to spare Gem&#8217;s life, and he becomes her prisoner. Their relationship starts with them at odds with one another, basically hating each other&#8217;s guts, and I <em>loved</em> that things were so complicated. I also loved that Isra was not necessarily in a position of power just because she was a princess; there are a lot of political machinations at work in this story that thrilled me because I enjoy that kind of thing. She was as much of an outcast in the domed city as Gem, if for different reasons. They&#8217;re both complex characters with secrets and agendas of their own, with a lot of differences to reconcile between them. This made their romance so much more gratifying to me. It was hard-won, and therefore felt more real and worthwhile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was so impressed with the depth and creativity of this alternate version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. If you&#8217;re a lover of fairytales, high fantasy, or even science fiction (this one has a bit of a sci fi twist to it here and there, although the fantasy aspect is more prevalent), then you should definitely give <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> a try. This is <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> like you&#8217;ve never seen before. I absolutely loved it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for more retellings of favorite fairytales? Here are some of my favorite twists on <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/" target="_blank"><em>Cinderella</em></a>, <a title="#3: SPINDLEâS END" href="http://novelideareviews.com/spindles-end/" target="_blank"><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></a>, and <a title="#2: EAST" href="http://novelideareviews.com/east/" target="_blank"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></a>. Ah, and some shameless plugging: if you remember the <a title="The Round-Robin Project" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-round-robin-project/">Round Robin writing project</a> I announced on the blog last month, then you may be interested to know that the girls and I decided to write an epic fairytale retelling ourselves! So stay tuned for more on that in the coming months :)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Beth Durst</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Bloomsbury Walker</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC via Netgalley; 370 pages</p>
<p><strong>ALSO BY THIS AUTHOR</strong>: <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank"><em>Vessel</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eve remembers nothing about her past. Her only clues are strange, often frightening scenes from her nightmares &#8212; fragmented memories of a storyteller weaving twisted tales and a magician whose act is more dangerous than it seems. But she knows that her origins are tied to a series of brutal murders and missing teenagers, and that the killer would do anything to find her. Even with a new face and the protection of a special branch of the Witness Protection Program, Eve is in danger every day, especially because of her own volatile magic&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year I fell head over heels in love with Sarah Beth Durst&#8217;s incredible high fantasy novel <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank"><em>Vessel</em></a>, so you can imagine my excitement when I saw <em>Conjured</em> up for request on Netgalley. I was completely enthralled by the premise, which promised this awesome magical murder mystery with creepy circus moments. You may think that&#8217;s a bizarre combination to send a girl&#8217;s heart racing, but I like most anything that includes magic and danger in the same sentence so this was a no-brainer for me. Plus I like to be creeped out once in a while, and <em>Conjured</em> certainly does have its eerie moments. While I don&#8217;t have the same breathless love for this book that I do for <em>Vessel</em>, I still liked it and it was a solid read for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3468"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Eve, but I liked the <em>mystery</em> of Eve even more. I appreciated that her amnesia didn&#8217;t make her into the kind of character that just stumbles along wherever the plot takes her. Oftentimes it seems that when characters lose their memory, the author uses it as a handy vehicle to dump all kinds of world building and backstory into the plot. But in this instance, the author turns Eve&#8217;s blank past into a catalyst for a hundred other questions you want to find the answers to. You know from the beginning that she&#8217;s important, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t be so adamant about protecting her from the killer. But what is Eve&#8217;s role in the case? Is she a victim, or an accomplice, or both? I was happy to see Eve taking matters into her own hands, even when her protectors would have preferred for her to be herded around like a sheep. And while she does want to know what happened to her in the past, and who she used to be, Eve doesn&#8217;t let her amnesia define her. She slowly reinvents herself, or I guess I should say rediscovers herself, and learns new things along the way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The magic was interesting, as was the surprise element of multiple worlds outside our own. But I was a bit put off by Eve&#8217;s relationship with Zach, and I didn&#8217;t warm up to him all that much even though I know I was supposed to find him adorable and quirky. Normally I&#8217;m all about the adorable and quirky, but he just didn&#8217;t click with me and I can&#8217;t explain why. I wasn&#8217;t a fan of the means by which Eve was able to share her magic with Zach &#8212; won&#8217;t go into it cause it may be considered a spoiler &#8212; but I one thing I did like about these two was that they worked very well together. They were a good team, even if I didn&#8217;t buy into their romance at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps my favorite parts of the book were Eve&#8217;s nightmares. That probably sounds crazy too, but like I said above, I like a little creepiness in my life! Err, as long as it&#8217;s not actually IN my life. I don&#8217;t mind reading about it. The dream sequences were exceptionally eerie and served to make the mystery even more compelling as a whole. Every time Eve had another nightmare, I was always left desperately wanting to know what it all meant and how the puzzle pieces fit together. Clues are scattered throughout her dreams, fragments of old memories that she lost before the story even began. I enjoyed trying to figure it all out. I admit that I was kept guessing through almost all of the story, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely satisfied with the ending or the way the main conflict was resolved; I felt a little bit disappointed, like all that build-up was for a lackluster conclusion. I was especially discomfited by Zach&#8217;s part of the ending, which only made my existing unease with his character even worse.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A solid read with a mystery wrapped up in strange magic and a bit of journeying between worlds. I enjoyed both the creepiness and the process of trying to put together all the clues to Eve&#8217;s forgotten past, but found some aspects of the plot disappointing and didn&#8217;t think much of the romance. I liked this book, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely crazy about it, or at least not as crazy as I am over <em>Vessel</em>. (Have I <a title="Vessel" href="http://novelideareviews.com/vessel/" target="_blank">talked that one up</a> enough?? Why aren&#8217;t you reading it yet??) Overall, despite how problematic I found some of it to be, I still had a positive experience with <em>Conjured</em>.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Elizabeth Wein</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 9/10/2013, Disney Hyperion; Digital ARC, 370 pages</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Netgalley</p>
<p><strong>RELATED READ</strong>: <a title="Code Name Verity" href="http://novelideareviews.com/code-name-verity/" target="_blank"><em>Code Name Verity</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rose Justice is the youngest member of a small group of female pilots ferrying planes for the Alliance during the fall of 1944. Fresh from a happy, somewhat sheltered life in Pennsylvania, she finds herself caught up in the war &#8212; its many tragedies, but also its many inspiring reminders that hope continues to exist even when everything seems to be in ruins. This is something that Rose learns and holds on to when she is caught by the enemy during an unplanned landing in Germany and shipped off to a concentration camp. In Ravensbruck, she learns to withstand cruelty in all its forms, relying on the human capacity to love rather than its capacity to hate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t ask me how I&#8217;m managing to sit at my desk and actually type full sentences right now. At the rate September is going, I&#8217;m going to be a total train wreck by the time October comes around. Not only are there so many new releases this month (and late last month; ahem, <a title="Crown of Midnight" href="http://novelideareviews.com/crown-of-midnight/"><em>Crown of Midnight</em></a>), but quite a few are also loaded with the kind of high-intensity feels that leave you in a state of shock afterward. They&#8217;re good books &#8212; <em>really, really good books</em> &#8212; but I swear I feel like I&#8217;ve been beaten black and blue with all this emotional reading material! This is definitely the case with <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17262236-rose-under-fire" target="_blank"><em>Rose Under Fire</em></a>, a title I already expected to break my heart. After all, that&#8217;s exactly what happened with its predecessor, <a title="Code Name Verity" href="http://novelideareviews.com/code-name-verity/" target="_blank"><em>Code Name Verity</em></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3308"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As some of you may know, <em>Code Name Verity</em> is one of my absolute favorite books of all time. This is a book that was the equivalent of a massive sucker punch to the feels, for me. I thought it was cleverly written, and the friendship between its two characters was both inspiring and heartbreaking. So when I started reading Rose Under Fire, I was bracing myself for all of this to happen again. I knew that the protagonist of this book would be spending most of the story as a concentration camp prisoner, so I was prepared for that &#8212; although of course her experience was still jarring to read about. What I didn&#8217;t expect was for Rose&#8217;s story to be connected to Verity&#8217;s. I loved seeing Maddie and Jamie here, and every time Julie was mentioned I swear I was always this close to just sobbing my face off. I thought this was a completely separate story, and I was ok with that, but it felt really good to see characters from <em>Code Name Verity</em> anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was really, really, REALLY hard not to compare <em>Rose</em> to <em>Verity, </em>especially because of how much I love the first book. I will say that this one keeps the fire burning, as Rose endures six months at Ravensbruck that change her forever, but never succeed in killing her spirit. She finds hope and deep friendship that sustain her through the freezing nights and gnawing hunger &#8212; a sisterhood of girls and women who fight back against their oppressors in any way they can. Together, they brave unbelievable cruelty and overcome their differences. It&#8217;s a powerful example of women working together rather than taking each other down, and you know I&#8217;m always a firm supporter of that. Something I loved about <em>Verity</em> was the way nothing could keep its characters down, even faced with the most unspeakable horrors. They were human, and they could bleed and be broken, but there was this light inside them that never went out. The same goes for Rose and her fellow prisoners, who pull together to become a family in a place where it seems all love and joy are lost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you weren&#8217;t a fan of <em>Verity</em>&#8216;s unconventional writing style, you may like <em>Rose</em> better. It&#8217;s a much more straightforward read, although still told mostly in flashbacks through letters and Rose&#8217;s journal entries. Alix liked Verity as well (just not as much as I did) but had a problem with the big POV switch between the two main characters a little over halfway in, which actually unsettled me as well. This doesn&#8217;t happen here, since we are with Rose throughout the entire story. The narrative still revolves quite a bit around planes and flying, which is a bit confusing at times when you have no knowledge of the subject. Rose is a pilot, so this makes sense, but if you&#8217;re like me and are NOT a pilot at all, it might be kind of distracting to hear about it so much. Another thing &#8212; and I hate to gripe about this, but I&#8217;m gonna be honest &#8212; is that I really didn&#8217;t like Rose&#8217;s attempts at poetry in the beginning of the book. Later on, though, there were some poems that actually made my heart ache. One in particular got highlighted to death and then copied into my quotes notebook, if that says anything at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I want to address before I finish up this review is that I&#8217;ve seen some complaints out there about how Elizabeth Wein wrote a book about concentration camps but didn&#8217;t really mention Jews. I see why this is might be bothersome to others, but I didn&#8217;t see anything wrong with it. Jews were not the only victims of Hitler&#8217;s regime. I think it&#8217;s a good thing that the author chose to highlight the experiences of other groups during WWII as well, because I feel like those are often overlooked. For future generations to truly understand the darkness of that time in history, we need to look at it from all sides, and not just from one perspective. Rose&#8217;s adopted sisters in Ravensbruck told her to tell the world. I feel like we need to tell the world every story we can, stories of hope and survival, regardless of barriers like race and religion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Rose Under Fire</em> didn&#8217;t have the same impact on me that <em>Code Name Verity</em> did, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I disliked it. It&#8217;s a different kind of story; while Verity always made me feel like everything was balanced precariously on the edge of a knife, Rose felt like an invisible force holding me up. It doesn&#8217;t make your heart race with danger, but it makes your heart ache with both sorrow and unshakeable hope. Overall, I think hope is the message of both books, and I highly recommend both. They&#8217;re unforgettable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many thanks to Disney Book Group for providing me with an advanced copy of this book in exchange for my honest review! Rose Under Fire hits bookstores everywhere on September 10th &#8212; DON&#8217;T MISS IT!</p>
