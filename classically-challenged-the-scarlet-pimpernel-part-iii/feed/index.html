		<description><![CDATA[I think I might almost be at what is the equivalent of this part of the story in Across a Star-Swept Sea. The feels have been ramping up, and i think after reading this, it&#039;s safe to assume those feels are only going to come on more. I think I would really like The Scarlet Pimpernel; I&#039;m love Across a Star-Swept Sea!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[IKR?? Marguerite could write a book on espionage that Chauvelin&#039;s lackeys would need to study as required reading. They need help. 

Flaily notes are obligatory in order to fully express how this book is making me feel!

Next Friday! And then I might post the finale on Saturday just to NOT wait another week for the last bit.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahh so hilarious!!  Chauvelin should be taking notes on Maurgerite&#039;s spy skills, cause those French spies need to learn about subtlety!  And the addition of your flaily notes are a plus!  I am super happy there&#039;s another part coming, though I can&#039;t wait to read what you thought of the ending!]]></description>
