		<description><![CDATA[I had mixed feelings about The Lizzie Bennet Diaries. I followed it across all social media platforms and while I liked what they did in theory; in practice I had some major issues with some of the narrative decisions and character portrayals.

As I mentioned, Persuasion is my second favourite Austen novel after P&amp;P and highly recommend it! :) I think it appeals to an &quot;older&quot; fan.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had to read P&amp;P for an English Lit class in college, and really enjoyed it. Then I reread it last summer, since my oldest niece was also reading it for her HS English class. Then I got into the Lizzie Bennet Diaries on YouTube/Twitter/Tumblr, and really had a good time with that.

I&#039;m definitely interested in some of the other novels in the project, as well as the project&#039;s premise in general. P&amp;P, Jane Eyre, Crime &amp; Punishment, Monte Cristo, Les Mis, Phantom, Frankenstein, Around the World in 80 Days, The Time Machine ...]]></description>
