		<description><![CDATA[This book sounds so interesting. I love the idea of girls coming together instead of trying to tear the other apart. The love interest seems interesting as well. You&#039;re really making me think I need to read &lt;i&gt;everything&lt;/i&gt; by Dessen now, Paola. Great review!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Um, RIGHT???? The lie detector is probably my favorite cyborg enhancement ever. And yes, it is definitely a double edged sword. Sometimes you&#039;d rather be lied to &gt;&lt;

DEFINITELY pick it up!!! I recommend it :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Excuse me??? I&#039;m totally sold after reading that Cinder has a built-in lie detector. That&#039;s like SUPER awesome but I imagine it&#039;d hurt to discover if your best friend of maybe 20 years is lying to you on something important. Well, one can&#039;t have everything eh! I&#039;ll be sure to pick Cinder up soon! ;D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I LOVE Maggie&#039;s words too! Preach it, girl! :D I love that this book shows the friendship between girls and how we can support each other rather than tear each other down, even if we are very different in personality. This book is already on my TBR list and it&#039;s something that sounds really good. I&#039;m glad you liked it, Paola! Yay for Dessen!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This book sounds really interesting, but it sounds like a &lt;i&gt;The Truth About Forever&lt;/i&gt; would be a better Sarah Dressen book to read for a first timer. Then this one. Great review :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Kim, I hope so!!! Before last month I&#039;d never read a Dessen book either, and now I&#039;m hopelessly hooked! Maybe one of our reviews will give you an idea for which one you&#039;d like to read first!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, I definitely agree with this! A strong heroine doesn&#039;t let anything stand in her way! And a good point about unexpected heroes as well. There are so many ways to define a good hero!]]></description>
