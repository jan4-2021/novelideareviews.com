		<description><![CDATA[...Dorian has gone to new depths? T____________T GIVE ME MY BOOK NAOOOOOOOOOO T_T I have a feeling Dorian is gonna be my squishy for this series because when I ship something fantastic like Celaena/Chaol, I always need a squishy. I can&#039;t tell you what&#039;s a squishy but probably I need someone to weep with. T_T]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am in total agreement of the feels here!  So much cake needed!!  And if Chaol could come by my house and drop some off that would be great!  Wait, okay I know he&#039;s yours, I&#039;ll settle for Dorian! :D  I noticed you gave this one 5/5 and Throne of Glass 4.5/5 so I see you really loved the sequel - awesome! :D

Oh yeah, Fleetfoot is safe! At least I can take comfort in that for the long reading road I&#039;m on!]]></description>
