I ordered the last two books in the series over a week ago but then they got lost in the mail and the shipper had to resend them ... so I still don&#039;t have them :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love love love this post. What an incredible book Quintana of Charyn was. I agree with you guys, it was perfectly satisfying. And I&#039;m not going to lie- I did cry. One relationship that kind of stood out to me was Lyra and Froi. I think I cried during one of their scenes. Isaboe is also my favourite. The gifs are all pretty spot on too. It shocks me that this series is not a major bestseller because I think it deserves to be there. Definitely one of my favourite fantasy series ever.]]></description>
