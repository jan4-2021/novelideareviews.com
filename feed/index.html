<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 266 Pages (2011)</p>
<blockquote><p>Since her parents&#8217; bitter divorce, Mclean and her dad, a restaurant consultant, have been on the move &#8211; four towns in two years. Estranged from her mother and her mother&#8217;s new family, Mclean has followed her dad in leaving the unhappy past behind. And each new place gives her a chance to try out a new persona: from cheerleader to drama diva. But now, for the first time, Mclean discovers a desire to stay in one place and just be herself &#8211; whoever that is. Perhaps her neighbor Dave, an academic superstar trying to be just a regular guy, can help her find out. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8492856-what-happened-to-goodbye" target="_blank">from Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>Mclean has let herself be defined by her parent&#8217;s divorce. SheÂ jumps on the opportunity to essentially run away from everything relating to the divorce by going to live with her father. She doesn&#8217;t deal with her emotions and instead hides in the new personalities she creates for herself in each new town, knowing that she&#8217;ll be able to reinvent herself in a few months.</p>
<p>I found that it did a wonderful job of addressing how a child feels after their parent&#8217;s divorce and the unfortunate tendency of parent&#8217;s to think what happens between them doesn&#8217;t impact the child.Â I did enjoy the characters and book but something throughout lacked for me. I liked Mclean; I understood her pain and sympathized with her. I was completely on her side about how she felt about her mom and understood why avoiding was easier and bringing up the painful subject. Where the story lost me was how Mclean ended up dealing and resolving her feelings towards her mom. It just didn&#8217;t work for me.Â There was a similar situation inÂ <i>The Sea of Tranquility</i>Â and I found that the way that author revealed the main character&#8217;s pain to her family and how it brought her and the family to talk and start to resolve their issues so well that I was hoping for something similar here but didnât get it. The catalyst between McLean and her mother didnât work for me: it felt sudden and the shift in McLeanâs attitude too sudden. I knew that Mclean would eventually start mending the fence with her mom but I wanted more of it. I wanted to read more about her mom talking with Mclean and making dealing with what she says. So much of the story and Mclean is defined by her mother&#8217;s actions towards herÂ yet at the peak of their story, I felt it fell flat.<br />
<span id="more-2445"></span><br />
I really loved Opal; the manager at the restaurant McLeanâs dad is consulting for and Deb, McLeanâs neurotic friend. They were wonderful characters! I liked Dave. I thought that there was a nice parallel between Mclean who likes reinventing herself completely andÂ Dave who has been defined as the &#8220;brainy&#8221; kid by his parents his whole life and is now trying to find the balance between being the brainy kid and a regular teenager (the path that Mclean is ultimately own in this story). Dave was a good love interest, albeit the love story is very secondary. I found he was a good match for Mclean and enjoyed their interactions. I just wished we had had more of them. Another aspect that I liked was how Dessen is able to have female and male characters be just friends, in this case Dave and his best friend Riley. It&#8217;s always refreshing to see that clichÃ© be broken and not deal with the &#8220;jealous best friend&#8221; storyline.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p>Overall I enjoyedÂ <em>What Happened to Goodbye</em>. It does a really good job ofÂ portrayingÂ the pain of a child of divorce. Dessen continues to excel at writing believable and sympathetic teenagers. While this is not my favourite Dessen novel, it&#8217;s still a great story about healing, rebuilding relationships and finding a new place for yourself.<i><br />

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 383 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Auden has always felt more alive at night. She escapes the confines of her quiet, scripted life and drives out into the darkness, drinking coffee in all-night diners or just feeling the wind on her face. When she decides to do something different for the summer and stay with her father, stepmother and newborn stepsister in the seaside town of Colby, Auden doesn&#8217;t expect her nocturnal existence to change. But as it turns out, she isn&#8217;t the only one who stays up all night, and despite everything she&#8217;s learned to believe, change still can happen to anyone and anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have so much love for this book. I know it&#8217;s often the case that the first book you read from an author is the most magical experience and you won&#8217;t be able to recreate it. Sort of like a law of diminishing returns, only for books. But <em>Along For the Ride</em> surprised me by quickly becoming a contender for my favorite Dessen book ever, and this is after reading four of her books within the last few weeks. If you choose <em>The Truth About Forever</em> as your first Sarah Dessen novel, make <em>Along For the Ride</em> your second.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2392"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Auden right away, I think partly because I&#8217;m a night owl too. I completely understood the appeal of those late hours between midnight and sunrise, when it really does feel like the world is different. During the day, Auden is so serious, so diligent; she&#8217;s spent her entire life trying to be the kind of girl her scholarly, extremely feminist mother might want for a daughter. Meanwhile, her father has remarried and moved to a quaint beach town in the years since the divorce, and her brother Hollis is backpacking somewhere through Europe having the time of his life. Now it&#8217;s Auden&#8217;s last summer before college, and she finds herself longing for something to change, despite her mother&#8217;s assertion that people don&#8217;t change at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best thing about Auden as a protagonist was her tendency to choose the option that I never would have expected her to take. You can tell from the synopsis that she&#8217;s going to experience a transformation, and this is a Dessen novel so you know it&#8217;s going to happen regardless, but she surprised me by being SO proactive about the process. Yes, she is reluctant, but even in her reluctance Auden is ultimately the one who instigates the changes in her life. She personally chooses to do these things that are A) outside her comfort zone or B) not at all what she even WANTS to do and the result is a legit transformation for her character. I loved that her learning experiences were self-imposed. She tries these new things without an outside force shoving her into them. Auden actively chooses her path, which means she takes most of the credit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Along For the Ride</em> also features something we don&#8217;t see enough of in YA, across all genres: examples of women working together rather than plotting against each other. Auden has never had very many friends to begin with, least of all friends who are girls. Her mother looks down on women who like pink, fluffy, frilly things because she sees this as buying into the whole feminine stereotype, and her beliefs have pretty much colored the way Auden thinks. But this novel does an amazing job of showcasing women and girls supporting one another through friendship, sisterhood and motherhood, and it also makes a strong statement that liking pink, happy, frilly things doesn&#8217;t mean your brain is made of 100% fluff. In the words of Auden&#8217;s new friend Maggie, <em><strong>&#8220;Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn&#8217;t be about the either/or. We&#8217;re capable of more than that, you know?&#8221;</strong></em> Guys, <em><strong>I love this message</strong></em>. And I love that Auden discovers the beauty of having friends you can paint your nails with, gossip about boys with, do all those fun girly things with, and yet can still have intelligent conversations with at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, as awesome as the girls are, I can&#8217;t ignore the one very important guy. (Right???) The only Dessen boy I like better than Auden&#8217;s bike-riding, late-night shopping, coffee-drinking Eli is Wes from <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, and it&#8217;s an extremely close second. They are pretty similar I think, but what made me love Eli was the fact that he surprised me as much and as often as Auden did. And he wasn&#8217;t perfect &#8212; he made mistakes just like she did, and they were both running away from things they&#8217;d rather not think about or relive ever again. But Eli challenges Auden to try what she&#8217;s never done before, and to see things from different perspectives. Plus, can I just say that I love Dessen books for proving that romance is possible WITHOUT two teenagers getting all hot and heavy all the time?? Call me old-fashioned, but I think it&#8217;s more effective, as well as refreshing.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from a few snags in the plot towards the end (that made me scream at Auden while shaking my iPad and trying to will the words to fall out so I could rewrite them the way I felt things should be&#8230;), <em>Along For the Ride</em> was everything I&#8217;ve come to love about Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing, from the realistic and yet vibrant characters to the simple comfort of knowing that her stories have happy endings, no matter how complicated. It&#8217;s a light, heartwarming read that isn&#8217;t shallow. Oh, if you&#8217;ve read <em>Lock &amp; Key</em> (<a title="Lock &amp; Key" href="http://novelideareviews.com/lock-key/">which I reviewed yesterday</a>), Ruby&#8217;s key necklaces make an appearance in the store owned by Auden&#8217;s stepmother :) AND, if you&#8217;ve read <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, you&#8217;ll have to laugh while reading this because JASON TALBOT STRIKES AGAIN haha!!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 283 Pages (2008)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby knows how to fend for herself. After all, she&#8217;s been doing that for the past few months. Scraping a living together from her after school job, living alone in the little yellow house she used to share with her mother, she finally has a degree of independence. But the show is over, because her mother is missing and now Ruby&#8217;s estranged sister has reappeared in her life after years of not being there when they needed each other the most. Cora and her husband Jamie take Ruby back with them to their palatial home in the suburbs, enroll her in a prestigious private school, and seem determined to give her everything she lacked throughout her childhood. But why is living the easy life so much harder than getting by on her own?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby, the product of a brokenÂ  home and a single parent who isn&#8217;t much of a parent at all, is an entire world removed from the protagonist of <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, which was my first ever Sarah Dessen book. While Macy has a roof over her head, money in the bank and a pretty secure existence, Ruby has had to cope with abuse and neglect. When her sister whisks her away from what she knows, it&#8217;s like being relocated to an alien planet. <em>Lock and Key</em> deals with some tougher issues than I&#8217;ve seen so far in this author&#8217;s work, and while it had some flaws, I still think it handled those difficult topics very well, and that it ended with a familiar sense of hope that is iconic of Dessen&#8217;s books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2259"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, I have to mention that I love the way Sarah Dessen writes standalone novels that are still set in the same universe, so we get to catch glimpses of characters from other books (and wildly wave to them, if you&#8217;re a massive nerd like me) and get that extra little boost of comfort and familiarity. If you&#8217;ve read <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, some of Macy&#8217;s co-workers from Wish make a cameo appearance and it all takes place in the same neighborhood so Ruby&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law actually live in a neighborhood designed by Macy&#8217;s parents. I personally really like little details like this. It&#8217;s a lot like running into someone you know after years of not seeing each other, and having this resurgence of good memories from the last time you met. I enjoy seeing how all these different characters, with all their different stories and situations, can still be subtly connected to one another even in the smallest ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby wasn&#8217;t as endearing to me as Macy was, though I can&#8217;t put my finger on just why. I did admire her strength and her courage, and I did appreciate that she was this really tough girl having to learn how to trust others instead of alienate herself from them. I guess I just didn&#8217;t bond with her in the same way I bonded with Macy, who was slightly more accessible as a character. I did love Nate and thought he was pretty well-written; he surprised me several times, and his personality was just the thing Ruby needed to offset her own. The supporting cast, especially Ruby&#8217;s brother-in-law Jamie, were also wonderful and as memorable as I expected them to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I feel this book does best is portraying the fact that there are many different kinds of abuse. It doesn&#8217;t have to be physical. In Ruby&#8217;s case, she suffered from a neglectful parent even more than a physically violent one. One of the characters also deals with verbal abuse and neglect of a different kind, because a parent can still pay attention to their child, but in all the wrong ways&#8230; which is still neglecting their needs. Both Nate and Ruby are products of divorce, and you are able to see two different ways in which divorce affects children. I think these tough issues resonated with me more than Ruby did because as a teacher I&#8217;ve unfortunately seen a lot of this in my classroom. It&#8217;s saddening, but also makes me want to do something to help, and I liked that the characters strive to help one another &#8212; I especially like that they learn to reach out to others for that help instead of constantly internalizing or trying to deal with things on their own. So, I&#8217;d like to give the author props for handling sensitive subjects well and not trying to sugarcoat them or disguise them as something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing <em>Lock &amp; Key</em> accomplishes is an exploration of the different shades of being a family and the true definition of that word. Ruby struggles with this concept for the majority of the book, slowly learning what family means and how to accept the family that she has. Dealing with trust and abandonment issues makes this an uphill battle for her, but it was something that I found really heartening to watch unfold. There are so many different kinds of families, and not everyone in your family needs to be bound to you by blood. Friends are family too, and even broken families are still families. I was especially touched by Ruby&#8217;s relationship with her sister Cora because I&#8217;m a sister myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn&#8217;t have very many problems with the story, though I did think it was more predictable than <em>The Truth About Forever</em>. I thought Ruby and Nate&#8217;s private school, Perkins Day, was a little bit too utopian and therefore rather unrealistic, but it wasn&#8217;t something that I couldn&#8217;t relegate to the background while I focused on the characters and their growth instead. My other problem was with the resolution of things with Nate, which felt kind of unsatisfying to me but at the same time was appropriate in a lot of ways, so I couldn&#8217;t rail against it as much as I wanted to. I mean, the way things went with him made a lot of sense, even if it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to happen, and I can accept that. I guess. Maybe. LOL.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Dessen offering takes us through darker territory than most of her books, with a protagonist that has to pick up the pieces after a lifetime of abuse and instability. But it&#8217;s also infused with strong messages about breaking the cycle of abuse, as well as the meaning of family, and how the ties we forge with other people have so much power to help and to heal.</p>

We both agree that her books truly capture the magic and possibility of summer, but also the hope that the season brings with it &#8212; hope for change, for growth, for good luck and new love. The days are getting longer, the nights seem to last forever, and it&#8217;s a time for both hello and goodbye. Whether you&#8217;re planning vacations or stuck in the office for the next few months, we wish you all the warmth of a Sarah Dessen summer :)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola:</strong> I think most of our regular readers know that I don&#8217;t usually read contemporary. I confess that this is actually my first ever Sarah Dessen summer; I read my first book by this author just last month! I&#8217;m being completely honest when I say that it was one of the most unexpected experiences of my reading life. I&#8217;ve since embarked on a quest to get my hands on every book she&#8217;s ever written, if that&#8217;s any indication of how much I love her work. She always leaves me with characters who feel like my best friends and so much to think about long after I&#8217;ve turned the last page.Â <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alix:</strong> I really enjoy Sarah Dessen. I think she is one of the best contemporary YA authors currently publishing. What I&#8217;ve enjoyed the most of about her is how she is able to capture real life, in a non-mundane and clichÃ©d way. She can take the simplest storyline and premise and make it interesting. Her stories and characters ring true. The drama or issues her characters deal with are things we have all gone through or are able to relate to: they aren&#8217;t over the top without being boring and predictable. Whether you&#8217;re already a contemporary YA or wanting to try it out, I highly recommend you pick up a Dessen book!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">We&#8217;re reviewing a Sarah Dessen book every day this week, with a giveaway on Friday!</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 376 Pages (2004)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pursuit of perfection is something Macy knows by heart. She strives to be the perfect student, the perfect girlfriend, the perfect daughter, to the point that she can barely remember who the real girl is underneath. Deep inside, the real Macy is weighted with guilt and regret, still grieving in the wake of her father&#8217;s death and feeling disconnected from everyone and everything. But this is the summer when Macy will learn to let go &#8212; to be her true self, and to live fearlessly, despite how unpredictable and imperfect life can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So! This was my first ever Sarah Dessen book, recommended to me by the lovely Ana at <a href="http://t.co/cQarM2mD3s" target="_blank"><em>Anahera Reads</em></a> when I was looking around for a good YA Contemporary for this event. I have to admit that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to try this author&#8217;s books for YEARS. I came in half expecting something insubstantial and/or hormonal to the extreme, but my perceptions were completely changed by the time I turned the last page. Well, long before that, actually. The fact that I loved this book so much is kind of crazy, because I am definitely not a big contemporary reader, and definitely not in the YA genre. I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I find it hard to enjoy contemporary books because they just don&#8217;t seem like enough of an escape for me, but I am now making an exception for Sarah Dessen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; Actually, this book kind of sent me on a crazy Dessen binge. I HAVE NO REGRETS. <em>The Truth About Forever</em> surprised me with its candid look at grief, the vibrance and believability of its characters, and the small, poignant moments that I still haven&#8217;t forgotten even weeks after reading it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2243"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love this book for its realistic take on what being a teenager is like. Since I read a lot of YA, the average age range is anywhere between 15-19 years old, and not every book has a believable take on being that age. Maybe my own experience with being in high school was the most grossly unexciting thing ever, but sometimes I run into teenaged characters who do things or live these lifestyles that seem so farfetched. Macy, however, is someone you can easily accept as being 17 years old, in that final summer before senior year and dealing with issues that are both relevant and understandable. Grief is such a powerful force, and it has shaped the way she&#8217;s been living her life. She was a character I sympathized with, but also a character I wanted to hug REALLY HARD. I liked her immediately. And I was thrilled to see that the teenagers in this book weren&#8217;t living this constant dramafest 24/7, with hookups and breakups and some new *disaster* every 5 minutes. They were just ordinary people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I think it would be pretty accurate to say that it&#8217;s the art of finding meaning in the ordinary and the everyday that makes Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing so easy to enjoy and identify with. I&#8217;m figuring that out with every Dessen book I read. Her stories are warm and inviting, but not superficial in any way. And the thing is, even though reading this book was a lot like watching a feel-good movie, and even though some things were predictable in the way feel-good movies usually are, I didn&#8217;t care. I liked it anyway. It was comforting, a lot like sitting down at Starbucks with an old friend and just talking for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Wes. I <em>loved</em> Wes. I loved the entire cast, really. Minus Jason, but you aren&#8217;t really supposed to love him, and I mostly felt sorry for the guy. The book is full of people you can&#8217;t help liking. They&#8217;re funny, memorable, and have really distinct personalities. Their interactions and relationships with one another were so natural. The writer has a gift for creating characters you could easily picture living next door, waving to you from their driveway, and she even makes you wish you could really wave back.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Truth About Forever</em> is the story of one summer, with all its small joys and sorrows. It&#8217;s the little things that all add up to a bigger picture, for Macy and for the reader. It made me smile, but it also made me think, and because of that I decided I was okay with the story being a bit predictable. After all, there&#8217;s something about knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going and how to get there, and sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a book hold your hand and make you feel like you&#8217;re home. I highly recommend it, and Sarah Dessen in general, whether you&#8217;re a big fan of contemporary or a stranger to it like I was.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Today I&#8217;m over the moon because I get to post this awesome <strong>interview</strong> as well as <strong>a reader&#8217;s choice giveaway</strong>!</h4>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Interview with Andrea K. HÃ¶st</span></h3>
<h4>- I think your books feature some very strong heroines, which is one big reason why I love them so much. Which heroines in fiction are your favorites or are the most inspiring to you, and why?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My favourite heroines tend to be the practical ones.Â  Who figure out ways to get around hurdles.Â  They don&#8217;t necessarily have to be the smartest, or the fastest, or the cleverest or the prettiest, or even to succeed nine times out of ten &#8211; but they work best for me if they&#8217;re sensible.Â  I also like them wry or sarcastic, and generous of spirit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think Sophie Hatter from &#8220;Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle&#8221; is one of my favourites.Â  Sophie underestimates herself &#8211; she thinks she&#8217;s fated to fail, but she doesn&#8217;t allow resentment to colour her relationship with her prettier/more-fortunate sisters.Â  When she&#8217;s transformed, she gets a bit flustered, but she adjusts to her situation and starts looking for ways to cope.Â  She starts to stand up for herself, and doesn&#8217;t back down when it&#8217;s important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2256"></span></p>
<h4>- Since you mentioned Sophie from Howl&#8217;s Moving Castle, I&#8217;m now curious &#8212; have you seen the film adaptation? If so, what did you think? (I happen to be a huge fan of Sophie as well!)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoyed it.Â  I&#8217;d read and loved the book long before I saw the movie, and naturally there were a lot of things the movie changed, but it was still a beautiful movie, and caught the magic of the tale, if not the details.Â  It&#8217;s one of a small handful of movies I own on DVD and I re-watch it occasionally &#8211; though I think I re-read the book a little more often.</p>
<h4>- What qualities do you think a &#8220;strong heroine&#8221; should have? What does that role mean to you?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a love of stories of &#8220;girls doing stuff&#8221;.Â  Or &#8220;women getting stuff done&#8221;.Â  A heroine is a fairly broad word, and can cover all types of women.Â  A heroine might be brash, she might be shy, she might be able to level mountains, she might have little ability to defend herself, she might skin rabbits, she might love dress-up, she might be a coward, or even a little bit cruel.Â  But she is willing to make a stand or take risks for the things which are important to her &#8211; someone who acts when it is absolutely necessary.Â  I don&#8217;t have a great deal of tolerance for characters who don&#8217;t even try to help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is in addition to &#8220;strongly-written&#8221; or &#8220;not a paper-thin cipher&#8221; (which is what I think of when someone talks about &#8220;strong female characters&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;strong heroine&#8221;). In other words, someone who seems rounded and real.</p>
<h4>- I&#8217;ve read about your experience with trying to get published traditionally and why it brought you down the self-pub route. What would you say is the best thing about self-pub vs. traditional?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The control.Â  Not having my ability to bring my stories to readers locked away behind a gate.Â  I never want to sent in a submission again &#8211; it&#8217;s such a negative part of the publishing process.</p>
<h4>- Which of your characters would have the easiest time getting along with?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, a toughie.Â  I suspect I&#8217;d find a lot of my characters intimidating.Â  I think I&#8217;d really like Ketzaren from First Squad in the Touchstone Trilogy.Â  I like the dry, sarcastic people.</p>
<h4>- Conversely, whose personality would probably clash with yours?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I doubt I&#8217;d like Kajal or Forel from &#8220;The Touchstone Trilogy&#8221;. Of the main characters, I suspect Strake from &#8220;Champion of the Rose&#8221; would be difficult to deal with.Â  He does try hard to control his temper, but it would still take a lot of energy to deal with him.</p>
<h4>- Have any of your characters surprised you or taken a different path than what you intended while writing?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my villains decided she was far better than I&#8217;d thought her, and refused to be behind all the evil machinations.Â  I had to go back and insert a new character into that book just to have someone to blame.</p>
<h4>- How much of your own personality finds its way into the characters you write?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bits and pieces.Â  I&#8217;ve never written a character that felt like &#8220;me&#8221;, but they will quite often hold suspiciously similar opinions on certain matters.Â  And sometimes they&#8217;ll be quite different &#8211; Cass Devlin, for instance, went through a patch of enjoying drinking and smoking, and I&#8217;ve never liked either.</p>
<h4>- I love how immersive and detailed your fantasy worlds are; it&#8217;s definitely one of my favorite things about your writing. Do you have a process for world building, or do you allow the settings of your stories to develop organically as you write? I know you state on your blog that you&#8217;re not an outliner but I wondered if this applies to creating the setting as well.</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m definitely a discovery writer where it comes to the world, as well.Â  Though there are a lot of shades in between &#8220;making it up on the fly&#8221; and &#8220;writing an outline&#8221; first.Â  I usually start with a scene or an idea, write the first chapter or two, and by the time I&#8217;m done with that I have a very good idea of where the story is heading, and know a fair bit about the world &#8211; which becomes more detailed the longer I write.Â  The story I&#8217;m writing at the moment ,&#8221;The Pyramids of London&#8221;, is set in an alternate version of our world, and I have four support documents &#8211; a map, a glossary, a character list and a timeline, and as I write further into the novel, I add details and events to the support documentsÂ  to keep track of things I&#8217;ve &#8216;discovered&#8217; or decided about the world.Â  Because it&#8217;s alt-Earth there&#8217;s a lot of detail to keep track of.</p>
<h4>- Do you have any advice for aspiring writers out there?</h4>

<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Ebook, 448 Pages (Atria Books)</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">Former piano prodigy Nastya Kashnikov wants two things: to get through high school without anyone learning about her past and to make the boy who took everything from herâher identity, her spirit, her will to liveâpay.</span><br />
Josh Bennettâs story is no secret: every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.</p>
<p>Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and wonât go away until sheâs insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets sheâs been hidingâor if he even wants to.

<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is aÂ beautiful, heartbreaking, gut wrenching, haunting, dark and hopeful novel. I finished it about a week ago (after reading it in one sitting!), and the emotions it caused in me still feel fresh and truthfully I am still processing them. Can you tell I loved it? Because I think saying I loved this book is an understatement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya Kashinkov is a strong but broken teenager. Hoping to escape her past, she moves in with her aunt and starts at a new school. But she isn&#8217;t the daughter and niece her family remembers: she&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t spoken in over a year and dresses as inÂ provocativeÂ manner (she calls it her &#8220;russian whore&#8221; look). Right from the novels start, we&#8217;re made aware that something horrific has happened to Nastya, she was a piano prodigy but is no longer, she has died and been brought back to life (but not to who she was). Nastya story&#8217;s isÂ purposelyÂ revealed in a slow manner and in works. I&#8217;m not usually a fan of slow reveals but in this case, it was done so well and in a natural manner that is really worked for me. The story is told from the POV of Nastya and Josh, something that works incredibly well here. I really enjoyed getting each character&#8217;s perspective and in the case of Nastya, it showed the duality of just how strong she is while also being deeply affected by the past events.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya as a character is depressing but also amazing. She clearly suffering from the result of a traumatic event: she chooses not to speak, to beÂ invisibleÂ yet also puts herself out there in aÂ confrontationalÂ manner with how she dresses. She could have easily become the clichÃ©d emo character but she isn&#8217;t at all. Her innerÂ monologueÂ gives you the insight into how she doesn&#8217;t want to be this person yet doesn&#8217;t know how to be who she was. She doesn&#8217;t want to hurt people and yet she feels like she always is. Â She feels like she can&#8217;t be saved and yet you know that she wants to be. I felt her pain, even before the revelation of what happened to her was done (in aÂ trulyÂ hard to read in that fantastic kind of way). There were times when I wanted to shake her and make her do things differently, but it was in that way you want to do when you care about someone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Josh Bennett, the other lead of the story and Nastya&#8217;s love interest, is an equally broken character, albeit in a different. Everyone is Josh&#8217;s life has left him and now he just wants to shut down and be invisible. But that changes with the arrival of Nastya. The dynamic between Josh and Nastya is captivating. The give and take, push and pull, had me turning page after page. I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of them. And this went beyond just them falling for each other. Their romance is perfect in that imperfect kind of way but what I loved the most was that at the core of their relationship was an understanding of each other&#8217;s pain that one else could. Josh doesn&#8217;t save Nastya and Nastya doesn&#8217;t save Josh but rather Â knowing each other brings them to a place where they want to change and heal their pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TheÂ surroundingÂ cast are also wellÂ developedÂ and interesting. I loved the dynamic between Nastya and Josh&#8217;s best friend Drew. Their own relationship and Drew&#8217;s character are both given the time and importance to beÂ developedÂ and explored. None of the characters in the story felt like throwaway orÂ place-fillers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll say it again, the story is beautifully written. It is a time a very dark novel, the hinted to events thatÂ occurredÂ to Nastya are disturbing and they way her post-traumatic stress manifest itself is hard to read at time. But the magic ofÂ <em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is that this is so well done that youÂ sympathizeÂ and cheer for the characters. The pitfalls of the &#8220;emo&#8221; broken girl are pretty much avoided. The writing is by far some of the best I&#8217;ve read (and not just in the YA genre).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both these characters are damaged people, you understand why they turn away from the world the way they do and yet with each other, they find the hope needed to break free of the darkness. It&#8217;s truly beautiful story telling.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is amazing story telling that affects you to your core. Nastya and Josh are wonderful, real characters. I cannot praise this book enough! Definitely pick up a copy of it if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>A huge thank you toÂ Atria Books for making this book available for review via NetGalley.</p>

It&#8217;s just wrong, you guys.</h4>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hunting.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2293 alignleft" alt="hunting" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hunting.jpg" width="149" height="228" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TITLE</strong>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13456081-hunting" target="_blank"><em>Hunting</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Andrea K. HÃ¶st</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 264 Pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ash Lenthard doesnât call herself a vigilante. Sheâs merely prone to random acts of derring-do, and occasional exhibitions of tomfoolery. Her friends, the Huntsmen, have never stepped over the line while patrolling the streets of Luinhall.</p>
<p>That was before the murder of Ashâs beloved guardian, Genevieve.</p>
<p>Now, Ash Lenthard is out for blood and even when the hunt sends her to the palace, on a collision course with a past identity she would do anything to forget, Ash cannot, will not, back down.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn&#8217;t just a fantasy book. It&#8217;s a <em>fantasy murder mystery</em>. How do you resist?? I mean, it has roof running, tree climbing, strategic gossip, undetectable poisons, shapeshifting mages, secret identities, and VENGEANCE. I can&#8217;t imagine what else you might want, except maybe an amazing female lead&#8230; WHICH IT ALSO HAS. If you&#8217;re not sold yet, I have no idea why. <em>Hunting</em> contains everything I love about Andrea K. HÃ¶st&#8217;s fantasy novels, from incredibly detailed world building to great, complex characters. Read on for more!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2255"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few constants in life, one of which is that I can always count on A.K. HÃ¶st to deliver a female lead that won&#8217;t disappoint me. The author has this to say about the protagonist of hunting: &#8220;<em>My need for a heroine capable of getting herself out of her own scrapes produced Ash Lenthard, who does not so much kick ass, as tap-dance across the heads of her enemies.</em>&#8221; Does she ever! Wily, resourceful, street-smart Ash has left her painful past behind, shedding her skin and becoming a boy who flies across rooftops with her band of Huntsmen. I loved that Ash is never sitting still. She&#8217;s always up and doing something, making the most out of what she has at her disposal. I love that she goes for what she wants instead of twiddling her thumbs. It gets so tiresome reading books in which the characters remain inert for long periods of time, whether it&#8217;s due to hesitation or insecurities or what-have-you. This is definitely not the case with Ash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plus she made me laugh, and frequently. Ash is one of those characters who is either getting herself into shenanigans or finding herself dropped right in the middle of them, and watching her extricate herself from situations ranging from awkward to dangerous is truly entertaining. She&#8217;s self-possessed, focused, and a born leader. I admired her confidence. (I&#8217;ve had really good luck recently with female protagonists who go around dressing like boys and then subsequently running circles around them. Also see: <a title="Scarlet" href="http://novelideareviews.com/scarlet/"><em>Scarlet</em></a> by A.C. Gaughen.) I also loved her relationship and banter with Rian Thornaster, the man she reluctantly teams up with to investigate Genevieve&#8217;s murder. They were more than a match for each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite things about this author&#8217;s fantasy books is her world building, which is so detailed that it boggles the mind. Ash&#8217;s world is no different; it&#8217;s a fully realized universe, and delving into it is akin to visiting a foreign country. You have to learn the language, figure out the nuances of its culture. It&#8217;s an exercise in discovery that occasionally proved to be a challenge due to the sheer volume of new things to absorb and process. I don&#8217;t mind a challenge, but keep in mind that there are no training wheels. The same has been true of other fantasy books I&#8217;ve read from this author, and I think it adds to how real they end up feeling. I loved the world introduced in <em>Hunting</em>, especially the complex relationship and balance between the gods, the people, and the land, which were all connected and intertwined. I read a lot of fantasy so it&#8217;s always refreshing to see new concepts and ideas in a genre where a lot of tropes are often re-used. Just another thing I&#8217;ve come to expect when I read A.K. HÃ¶st!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes a bit of an adjustment period to orient yourself in the world of <em>Hunting</em>, which is pretty complex. Lots of words, names, and cultural details to learn, but it&#8217;s a worthwhile endeavor. Ash Lenthard is an unforgettable heroine you can&#8217;t help rooting for, whether she&#8217;s falling down wells or protecting the people she loves. You may also like <em>The Medair Duology</em> (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9837154-the-silence-of-medair" target="_blank"><em>The Silence of Medair</em></a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10493660-voice-of-the-lost" target="_blank"><em>Voice of the Lost</em></a>), also by Andrea K. HÃ¶st, and the first of her fantasy novels I ever picked up. (I loved them too!)</p>

HÃ¶st! Please forgive me if the following review is borderline incoherent; I&#8217;m writing it directly after turning the last page and all the emotions are still punching me in the face&#8230;</h4>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/056_andallthestars.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2305" alt="056_andallthestars" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/056_andallthestars.png" width="150" height="231" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13411999-and-all-the-stars" target="_blank"><em>And All the Stars</em></a></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Andrea K. HÃ¶st</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 204 Pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Come for the apocalypse.<br />
Stay for cupcakes.<br />
Die for love.</p>
<p>Madeleine Cost is working to become the youngest person ever to win the Archibald Prize for portraiture. Her elusive cousin Tyler is the perfect subject: androgynous, beautiful, and famous. All she needs to do is pin him down for the sittings.</p>
<p>None of her plans factored in the Spires: featureless, impossible, spearing into the hearts of cities across the world â and spraying clouds of sparkling dust into the wind.</p>
<p>Is it an alien invasion? Germ warfare? They are questions everyone on Earth would like answered, but Madeleine has a more immediate problem. At Ground Zero of the Sydney Spire, beneath the collapsed ruin of St James Station, she must make it to the surface before she can hope to find out if the world is ending.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, I don&#8217;t read very much science fiction. I&#8217;m more of a high fantasy, embarking-on-perilous-quests, swinging-enchanted-swords kind of girl. I think it&#8217;s because the first sci fi books I ever tried felt so cold and clinical in comparison to the fantasy books I loved, with all these technical details and a lingering air of <em>so much math (??!)</em>. I realize that sounds more than a bit ridiculous BUT I can&#8217;t think of any other way to describe my lack of affinity with the genre. That being said, <em>And All the Stars</em> completely overturned every expectation I had. I love this book. It is so far from my usual fare, and yet managed to insinuate itself so close to my heart that I&#8217;m honestly still in shock right now as I write this review. There have been very few science fiction books I can say this about. I feel like if I wasn&#8217;t already a huge fan of the author, this one would&#8217;ve won me over for sure. If you haven&#8217;t picked this one up yet, <strong><em>you need to</em></strong>. Trust me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2257"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As indifferent as I&#8217;ve been to most of the sci fi genre, I will admit that I have this gross fascination for the post-apocalyptic. There&#8217;s something about the possibility of the world ending that piques my curiosity while simultaneously scaring me shitless. That giddy, panicked feeling stayed with me through most of my reading of this book, as the Spires appeared all over the world and Madeleine was trying to find a way to survive the sweeping changes overtaking the entire planet. As with anything post-apocalyptic, whether in films or in books, I always find it extremely unsettling to consider all the familiar things in life become suddenly obsolete or skewed. With this book in particular, you immediately get the sense that nothing is ever going to be same again &#8212; there&#8217;s no going back. That old way of life is dead, and now the world is divided according to the aftermath of the Spires and the chain of events that followed. Madeleine&#8217;s choices are to adapt or give up. It&#8217;s that simple, and that scary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#8217;t talk about much of the plot without horrendously spoiling it for you, so instead I&#8217;m going to talk about the characters of this novel and how much I came to love them. Madeleine, always more dedicated to her art than to cultivating friendships or relationships with others, finds herself surrounded by people she comes to love, people she supports and who support her in turn. They band together, pooling their resources, learning from one another, and face the apocalypse standing side by side. I think this warmth &#8212; these deep bonds between people all sharing a common goal &#8212; is what I&#8217;ve found missing in a lot of the science fiction I&#8217;ve read in the past. I liked every single one of Madeleine&#8217;s friends and allies, all for different reasons, and for all their varied personalities and backgrounds. They all just clicked together, each person providing something that the group needed, whether it was warmth or sustenance or security. I had no favorites, which is also extremely rare for me. I loved them all, and cared about their welfare, and found myself desperately rooting for their survival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the plot, though. Guys, don&#8217;t expect to have any idea what&#8217;s going on when you start reading this book. The experience is constructed so that you discover everything by degrees, at the same rate that the characters are learning it, and it really kept me on my toes. I was always peering around the next corner, holding my breath, wanting to know what new developments would come to the surface. I think it made it even more authentic of an experience because in real life, in the event of a disaster like this taking place, you would find things out gradually as well. You&#8217;d find things out the same way Madeleine does: through the news, via the vast social network that connects us across countries and continents, by witnessing pieces of it firsthand. No one ever knows everything that&#8217;s happening. Everyone&#8217;s experience is different, but combined, it&#8217;s like a puzzle being fitted together one piece at a time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the <em>twist</em>! What! How did I miss that?! I mean, I&#8217;m not going to say anything else about it, but it really caught me off guard. I didn&#8217;t see that coming at all, and I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t help loving a book that surprises me. And I thought the plot twist in this case added a new dimension to the story, and to Madeleine, that made everything even better. (Plus, facepunched by the feels. *sobs*)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a book for sci-fi believers and nonbelievers alike. And anyway, how do you turn down a book with a synopsis that opens with <em>Come for the apocalypse. Stay for cupcakes. Die for love.</em> ???????? Hello?? PLEASE READ IT NOW. <em>And All the Stars</em> is superbly written, with characters that just leap off the page and the ability to elicit emotions that I never imagined myself feeling for a novel about the world ending. It really just blew me away. It may be my new favorite A.K.Â HÃ¶st book.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m having somewhat of an A.K. HÃ¶st marathon this week, so stay tuned for tomorrow&#8217;s review of her latest novel, Hunting! I&#8217;ve got an interview and giveaway on Friday as well, so don&#8217;t miss it!!</p>
