		<description><![CDATA[Actually, I put off reading this book for SO LONG because I was terrified it would disappoint me! I\&#039;ve seen the same gushing reviews everywhere, too. I put off The Book Thief for the same reason. Happily, I ended up loving both. And LOL, definitely don\&#039;t base the book\&#039;s tearjerker qualities on me... I\&#039;m SO pathetic when it comes to emotional moments in books. I didn\&#039;t realize I would become so invested in Finn &amp; Evanjalin. ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Finnikin is still sitting on my shelf collecting dust, unfortunately. Even though I&#039;ve read countless of gushing reviews for it, I don&#039;t know why I haven&#039;t grabbed it off the shelf and plopped down in some nice cozy corner to read it yet! So happy that it worked out for you, too. Also, I don&#039;t doubt the book&#039;s ability to make people cry, but I kind of doubt it&#039;ll work on me (there&#039;s a reason why I&#039;m called heartless, lol). I&#039;m hoping I&#039;ll enjoy Finnikin as much as you did when I get to it! Wonderful review. :) ]]></description>
