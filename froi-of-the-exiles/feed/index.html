		<description><![CDATA[I love Isaboe &gt;&lt; I can&#039;t even talk about it! I admire her so much!! But she isn&#039;t perfect, and I like that about her too.

Usually the romance isn&#039;t such a huge part of why I love a fantasy novel but for this series, it really is. All of the relationships are just full of feels!!!!! Akjsdhfkjashdfakjsdf. CAN&#039;T HANDLE IT.

Oh no!!! NOOOO!!! You must finish this series!!! We&#039;ll find a way!! *determined*]]></description>

URGH!! I wish my trip would be over ASAP so that I can start reading Froi, it&#039;s been sitting on my table for the past week and I still can&#039;t get to it because I have to get out of town again! WHY, LIFE, WHY DO YOU TEAR ME FROM MY BOOKS SO HEARTLESSLY! *shakes fist*

		<description><![CDATA[I AM SO EXCITED. MORE ROMANCE. I HAVEN&#039;T HAD THESE KIND OF FEELS IN A WHILE. Uhm yes Isaboe is full of awesome, I couldn&#039;t have put it any better. So so glad we still get some of them and that we get to see some of Isaboe&#039;s weaknesses too. 

Froi really grew on me and his development was probably the most noticeable in the first book so I&#039;m really interested to read the second book and you know, GET MORE ROMANCE. YES MORE LUCIAN TOO. Super curious to find out more about Charyn too. 

I am getting this immediately after I return from China haha, provided the person who already borrowed it has returned it because someone has it already &gt;:( I am so sad my library doesn&#039;t have Quintana of Charyn. How am I going to continue this series? *panics*]]></description>
