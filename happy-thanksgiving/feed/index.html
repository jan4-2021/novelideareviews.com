		<description><![CDATA[See thatâs what makes Canadian Thanksgiving great is that it isnât tainted by the whole Pilgrims screwing over the Indians history! ;) (though we did plenty of that every other days of the yearâ¦).
That video is so cute (though also disturbing when you realize thatâs pretty much what happenedâ¦). Thanks for sharing it. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait, the real Thanksgiving?! o.O Did you have Pilgrims and Indians in Canada?! I don&#039;t think so! 

All joking aside (OK, not really) my favorite thing about the American Thanksgiving story is this video&#039;s interpretation of it... unfortunately, I think the original video is offline now (BOO HISS!!!) so you have to settle for this mediocre taping of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gy-jhIPtB3g]]></description>
