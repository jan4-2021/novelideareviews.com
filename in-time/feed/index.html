		<description><![CDATA[Right???? I didn&#039;t realize how much I love Zu until I read In Time. I just really want to hug her. I think that Ruby, Liam and Chubs kind of dominate the first book so it&#039;s awesome to see Zu in the spotlight for the novella. You will love it, I already know. Go read it so we can flail together please!!]]></description>

Gosh, definitely need more Zu in my life. I didn&#039;t get enough back story about her in TDM. I miss her and her rubber gloves, hehehe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Same here, I only rarely pick up novellas between series installments but I like when they&#039;re either a prequel or form a connection between two books. I hope you read The Darkest Minds soon and enjoy it! One of my favorites! Thanks Sam :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whoa. I had NO idea this novella even existed! I&#039;m not always keen on novellas, but I do enjoy them when they bridge the gap between different books in a series. I still need to pick up the first, but I have a copy and I&#039;ve heard such great things that I can&#039;t wait to eventually do so. Fantastic review! :)]]></description>
