		<description><![CDATA[I love Rinn and Alisa&#039;s stories! :)

Alright, since, as you know from last time, I can&#039;t do these things without naming everyone...
Instalover 1: April
Instalover 2: Gavin
Instalover 3: Colby

New student Gavin Wilson knew he was in love with April the moment he saw her chestnut ponytail swinging around the corner. He had to ask a new acquaintance for her name, and treasured the name April Woodley in his heart longing to meet her. 

As his luck turned out, in his fifth period world history class there she was, so absorbed in reading a book that she couldn&#039;t even make eye contact with him to solidify their instalove relationship! At least, not until class starts and the teacher introduces Gavin to the entire class. Then April&#039;s eyes met his and he knew she felt it too, the instalove connection!

They chatted after class, and then again the next day, and the next, and when he asked her out on a date to a cafe at an indie bookstore in town, she said yes! But when they arrived at the bookstore cafe, Gavin noticed April locking her eyes with that of the barista, and it&#039;s none other than fellow classmate Colby Smotherman! 

DUN DUN DUN

Of course they have to talk to Colby to order their coffee and paninis, and Gavin made a show of paying for April, his eyes flashing Colby a threatening message, just daring him to interfere with their instalove. But Colby was sly, and when he delivered the coffee and paninis, he also brought a book for April to read, something he knew she&#039;d love based on her based off her love for Teen Wolf and of course, there is a scene that involves a mud pie. 

Much like the mud pie April and Colby shared so many years ago in kindergarten. 

DUN DUN DUN

Who does April choose? Does instalove at first sight always win? Or sometimes, does a second-glance version of instalove end up being the most pure?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I so wanted to participate..IRL things have been so hectic..but I definitely want to participate in this because too much fun..squeee...

Instalover 1 is a booknerd who is so busy she has no time for BOYS, or INSTANT LOVE, she is the president of Tyler Posey fan club, spends most of her time gluing pictures of herself into photographs of him that she pulls out from her weekly subscription of TEEN magazine. One day she is in class and a transfer student(Instalover 2) has mysteriously moved to town, and mysteriously enrolled in her class, and SURPRISE he is assigned to her group. He is the quite moody type, with floppy hair that seems like he just woke up but really it just spent forty five minutes that morning blow, drying, applying generous gel to get it that way..but I digress. She attempts to make friendly small talk, but he stares MOODILY and SEXILY off into the distance pretending to ignore every word she says. At the end of class she turns to leave, when she turns around she sees his has been sniffing her hair when she wasn&#039;t looking..feeling quite disturbed she quickly leaves the room. What she doesn&#039;t realize is that this mysterious stranger upon sniffing her shiny, and perfectly straight pony tail has fallen DEEPLY and PASSIONATELY in love with her....he has a thing for hair products. 

That night she goes home to sit down and read her latest romantic YA novel, and re-watch season 1 of Teen Wolf. When she hears a rustling outside her window, she quickly runs over to take a look. Sitting in the tree outside her window is Instalover 2 who has dressed like Teen Wolf *he noticed the tons of photographs she has in her locker of Teen Wolf when he was lurking around the corner watching her after 4th period. He went home and immediately gets the DVD, but mistakenly he picked up the 1980&#039;s version with Michael J. Fox, so really he just looks like an idiot dressed up as a very hairy basketball player*


She asks him what he was doing out there and he tells her he loves her with all his heart, that why he likes to watch her sleep, eat, take out the trash, walk to get the mail and spend three hours making photo montages. At that moment she realizes how much she DEEPLY AND PASSIONATELY she loves him in return. They spend the next 30 minutes holding hands as he sniffs and brushes her hair.  

The next day she goes to school dreaming about Instalover 2 and drawing pictures of him in her notebook with hearts during her first period. When suddenly and mysteriously the SUPER HUNKY INSTALOVER 3 comes to sit next to her. She has known INSTALOVER 3 her whole life, but he never has spoken to her until that day. He suddenly declares his love for her and says that he will spend the rest of his life trying to win her over..plus he works at BARNES AND NOBLE..and has an awesome staff discount that he tells her she can use any time she wants...

Suddenly Instalover 1 is torn between her desire for book discounts and her DEEP AND PASSIONATE LOVE for Instalover 2. What is a girl to do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instalover 1 (IL1) is walking down the school hallway, with a teetering pile of books, when she walks straight into Instalover 2 (IL2). But of course, she&#039;s oh so clumsy and that&#039;s one of her many redeeming, cute and quirky qualities! She squeals and blushes (yet another cute mannerism) and goes to pick up her books, when IL2 begins to help her pick them up. She looks over to this stranger as he hands her a book and at the moment their hands meet - BOOM! Everything loses focus, she sees sparkles and roses and possibly unicorns? Cherubs float around them, playing harps, Cupid&#039;s arrow has struck. The only thing she can see is this gorgeous guy and she knows she HAS TO BE WITH HIM NOW AND FOREVER OR SHE WILL DIE AND BE SO MISERABLE AND LIFE WON&#039;T BE WORTH LIVING NO ONE WILL EVER SEPARATE THEM AND WHAT IS AIR.

IL2 is also staring right back at her, with his jaw hanging wide open and maybe a bit of saliva drooling out, after all he&#039;s been staring at her for five hours now. But it&#039;s his saliva so it&#039;s JUST SO CUTE AND GORGEOUS AND OMG. He&#039;s loved her ever since he saw that hair disappearing around the corner. The way its mousey colour reminded him of his favourite dog when he was a little kid. The scent of her Head &amp; Shoulders wafting behind her, a mere memory of her presence. And now she has noticed him and NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. LIFE GOAL ACHIEVED.

They&#039;ve been staring at each other for eight hours now, and a crowd is growing around them. They&#039;re kind of blocking up the hallway. Not a single word has been exchanged, but they know they are truly, deeply, madly in love, so you know, it doesn&#039;t really matter. Duh. What else could it be but love?]]></description>
