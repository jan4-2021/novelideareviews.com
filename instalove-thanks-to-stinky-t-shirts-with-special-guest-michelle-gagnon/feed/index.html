		<description><![CDATA[I remember watching a documentary about this experiment (or something similar) ages ago, and I found it really interesting! I&#039;m super happy to see it appear here in a discuss about Instalove. :D It&#039;s really fascinating to see how the biological side plays into attraction. :)

&quot;Because all things considered, instalove is nice, but permalove is better.&quot;

Yes, exactly! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember reading about those studies when I was in university! Psychologists run the weirdest experiments.  ;)

I don&#039;t think of that sort of situation as instalove, though.  I think everyone recognises that you do have some instant connection with some people when they walk in a room, and that&#039;s totally valid (insta-lust, if you will).  But for me, instalove is more when characters profess their undying love for each other, claiming they can&#039;t ever be apart again, when they&#039;ve only known each other a handful of days.]]></description>
