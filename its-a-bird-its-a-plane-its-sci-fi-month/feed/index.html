		<description><![CDATA[Actually Paola will write a completely rubbish first draft of her second book and then crawl under a rock for a while which should give you more time to hang out with Alix~~]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right?!? It took me awhile to remember it but it was probably my first introduction to sci-fi! 

I am! I&#039;ve watched all of the Nine, Ten and one series of Twelve! I&#039;m hoping to catch up though... I was a HUGE Ten/Rose shipper back in the day and am still traumatized by Blink. :P

That sounds like an awesome plan. :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah! When I was prepping my favourites lists, it made me realize just how many various shows/movies/books are technically scifi but are so different from one another. 

I LOVE LOVE LOVE Ready Player One. I read it a few years ago and again more recently and it still completely holds up. I can&#039;t wait to read Ernest Cline&#039;s next book. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m really looking forward to seeing the Ender movie. I&#039;m trying to manage my expectations but I love the casting so I&#039;m keeping my fingers crossed the writing is up to par. What other sci-fi books have you read? I&#039;ve read a fair mix of &quot;classics&quot; of the genre and contemporary YA ones. Both can be wonderful but also very different.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read Tandem and The Kife of Never Letting Go, but I&#039;ve had them on my massive TBR pile for awhile. Hopefully Sci-Fi Month will make me bump them up the list!

Yay for new Doctor Who fans! I&#039;m a huge fan of both Nine and Ten. Rose is still my favourite new series companion. Hooray for Scifi! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[OMG The X Files how could I have forgotten about that!  And I didn&#039;t know you are already a Doctor Who fan! I&#039;ll wait (im)patiently for your post on favorites, cause I&#039;m eager to know which Doctor is your fave, and what episodes you like (I&#039;m glad I already know about Blink :D)  

I&#039;m glad we&#039;ll get to read more from you through SciFi month!  It&#039;s win-win since Paola will write an awesome book, and I can fangirl with you over SciFi. LOL]]></description>
