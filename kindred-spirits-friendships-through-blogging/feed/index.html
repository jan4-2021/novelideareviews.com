		<description><![CDATA[I just want to say I LOVE your blog so much! The design is wonderful!

Growing up in school I had quite a few friends that loved to read. Once I graduated high school and went to college, that number dropped to about 2 friends. It wasn&#039;t until I started booktubing at youtube.com/priceiswong that I really started to make friends with readers again! I&#039;m blogging now as well and although I haven&#039;t really made friends yet in the blogging community I&#039;d like too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes! You can see a comment someone has made about something you both love and just know - like Dragon Age ;D People who judge others for liking Harry Potter (or actually, for liking books in general) are not worth our time! 

Well we are no longer a guild - our MMO closed down at the very end of 2009, but we&#039;ve tried several other games together and have now given up on trying to find another we&#039;ll all like, but keep in contact in various ways. And I&#039;m going to meet quite a few of them FINALLY towards the end of this year when I go to uni in the Netherlands, as several of them are Dutch and Belgian. Obviously I also need to head over the Atlantic too ;D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so right about not meeting as many like-minded people! For me, another good thing about mostly socializing online is that it kinda takes out that trial-and-error portion of making friends... like when you think you&#039;ll get along great and then something happens -- gasp, they don&#039;t even like to read! or, omg, they totally just judged me for liking Harry Potter! -- and suddenly the potential for being friends isn&#039;t so high anymore! (Not sure if you have any idea what I&#039;m talking about but whatever hahaha) At least online, you can approach people based on interests that you share because those interests are out in the open. Like the first time I ever talked to you on Twitter, when I saw your tweet about Dragon Age and knew we had to be friends!

That&#039;s awesome that you have a great guild cause I have never been able to find a good one in all the years I&#039;ve been gaming. Having a fun guild would probably have made MMOs more fun for me and I might still be playing them more actively now. 

Having people to flail over books with is THE BEST. I can&#039;t find anyone who does book-flailing quite as well as the friends I&#039;ve met online, so you and I are in the same boat there too!

Um, what! That&#039;s a great night in! CROSS THE OCEAN NOW SO YOU CAN COME OVER AND WE CAN DO THOSE THINGS PLEASE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;It is an infinite mystery to me how we twentysomethings meet new people outside of school.&quot; Right?? Well, I guess I could meet people if I went out to parties and clubs more or something, but they&#039;re not really my thing cause I&#039;m an old lady at heart. And not even one of those fun old ladies who do unexpected things like suddenly get tattoos. LOL. So true -- no one talks books like book bloggers! Our love for reading is in its own category haha.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, good for you!! That sounds fantastic! Maybe I should&#039;ve volunteered at the library too, haha. It&#039;s great that you&#039;re able to meet so many people who love books just by going to school. I think school definitely does bring more people into your life. I certainly knew more people and interacted with more who were my age back when I was in college.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Haha, no, it&#039;s definitely not just you being not-too-sociable cause I consider myself to be pretty sociable and yet can count my IRL friendships on one hand LOL. (But hey, quality over quantity!) I mean, it&#039;s useless being sociable like me when you have no real way to meet people, least of all like-minded people. Also YES it&#039;s difficult to find others who read as much YA! 

YES WHERE IS THE TELEPORTING MACHINE?? SO I CAN SEE YOU???

I can Photoshop a pic of myself into one of yours so it looks like we&#039;re in the same country instead of thousands of miles away, then you can show it to your gran! #BrilliantPlansByPaola

And lastly, I LOVE YOU AND I&#039;M SO GLAD WE&#039;RE FRIENDS. (TSUNSAMA FOR LIFE &lt;3)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Agreed, it IS fun to force books on people and then shriek over them together! I&#039;m glad that even though neither of us can do this very much IRL, we can both use the internet to make it happen haha! *hugs the book blogging community* 

You&#039;re right -- the massive outpouring of friendship and love I&#039;ve found through book blogging has been the biggest surprise ever. And also the best surprise ever!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwwww why do you live so far away?? I hardly ever meet people who are married, around my age, and don&#039;t have kids yet! Agreed, when kids come into the picture it changes friendships -- I mean, not in a negative way, but it&#039;s such a huge lifestyle change when you become a parent. We&#039;re planning to have kids someday too, just not right now. 

On the subject of connecting with people online, I am very glad to have met you :D]]></description>
