		<description><![CDATA[I honestly didn&#039;t think the trailer made it look that good, but then everyone was swooning over it, the holidays were crazy, my husband wasn&#039;t itching to see it in theater... so that&#039;s my excuse. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Frozen broke so many Disney clichÃ©s in such a wonderful way! I love how they called out the whole ridiculousness of instalove!

Claire&#039;s point about slow developing relationships being more real is spot on! Seems like everyone agrees on that! So glad you enjoyed her post. :)]]></description>

Jane Eyre is such a great book and a good example of the opposite of instalove. *eyes Jane Eyre on bookshelf* *add it to bedside table TBR pile*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What is up with all the people who haven&#039;t seen Frozen?!?!! I hope it&#039;s on Redbox soon, it&#039;s such a fantastic movie!

		<description><![CDATA[YOU MUST TO SEE FROZEN IT&#039;S SO GOOD!!!!! *cough* I might be a fan! :P

You&#039;re so right about the importance of being able to hold a conversation with someone! Just another reason why instalove can&#039;t work! 

We&#039;re so happy you enjoyed Claire&#039;s post! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awwww, the last few bits! So sweet! :) (Also OH YES FROZEN!)

I totally agree. If two characters are like &quot;omg our eyes met and there were fireworks therefore I must love you forever,&quot; I&#039;m just like &quot;... Really? That&#039;s all it takes?&quot; Like Claire, I really like it when they develop over time. They talk to each other, exchange quips, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This was such a lovely post!  Not just because I am overly partial to Jane Eyre, but because I agree with everything Claire said!  And it&#039;s kinda the best Claire included Frozen, JE and your own personal story in this post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had to skip the Frozen spoilers too! I&#039;m renting it as soon as it comes to Redbox because everyone loves it so much!

Anyhow, I absolutely love the kind of relationships that start of &quot;meh&quot; or even adversarial and then slowly turn into love over time. And they&#039;re definitely the most fun to read about! When I met my husband, he was also just another nice guy to me too, until I started to get to know him better and better over time. Great post!]]></description>
