		<description><![CDATA[Marie Antoinette is the serial killer! Well ghost serial killer! Did I not specify that? Oops! :P The premise was super cool. The execution was flawed though and the first part of the book wasn&#039;t exactly good but it ultimately was an easy read for me. But I&#039;m definitely in the minority of those who thought it was good.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It took me awhile to get into it. If it hadn&#039;t been an ARC, I think I would have given up but the second half of the book made up for the first part, for me at least. But I definitely can see why you couldn&#039;t get into it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This book disappoints me. I&#039;ve heard about it and from the title I honestly thought I was going to get a historical where Marie Antoinette was a &lt;i&gt;serial killer&lt;/i&gt; -- how cool would that be? And yet that&#039;s not what the book is about (at least I don&#039;t think so, unless Marie is the serial killing ghost? In which case awesome). But I&#039;m glad you enjoyed the book!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Favorite phrase from this review: &quot;severe teenage emoness.&quot; I TOTALLY GET WHAT YOU&#039;RE SAYING.

Nice that they added a few pages from the victims&#039; perspectives, that sounds like it would be creepy and fun to get that close to the mysterious ghost!! Glad this was a fun read for you :D]]></description>
