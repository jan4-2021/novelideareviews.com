		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your vote!! Personally I also like the forecasts better... it may be that we only post a book haul if we had a lot of books that month. Or maybe I&#039;ll start doing vlogs this year to make the process quicker, book haul posts always take me forever &gt;&lt;

I&#039;m curious too! It won by a landslide so it seems everyone must really like Emma. Also I&#039;m sure it doesn&#039;t hurt that Emma Approved had just started when I took votes, haha.

Yes, RR time at last! I don&#039;t know if I&#039;m ready for Tory to crush all my feels... *runs away*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I would much prefer forecasts but but BOOK HAULS! So I guess you guys could do both since they would be at different times of the month? 

Yay I&#039;m so excited you&#039;re doing Emma next month :D Really curious to find out what you think of it. 

AND YES FINALLY OMG ROUND ROBIN! Those little snippets you gave me and Charlene were simply not enough, MORE.]]></description>
