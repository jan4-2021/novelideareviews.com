		<description><![CDATA[What kind of iPad do you have Paola?! I would throw money at my Kindle but it won&#039;t do anything! You&#039;re going to have to come over and teach it how to listen to me haha. 

I already love the cover, it is stunning *O*  And magical fake mustache? THIS IS GOLDEN. 

I&#039;m going to have to somehow get this soon because I NEED IT. It sounds perfect and amazing and especially for us Duchesses!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes!! Read it!! And then let&#039;s talk about it!! You know, Regency romance is totally not a genre I normally read, not that I dislike it or anything. But this month it seems like every book I pick up is set in the Regency time period... coincidence?]]></description>
