		<description><![CDATA[Ah, I hope you read it soon and enjoy it, Nuzaifa!! Ugh it is one of my biggest pet peeves when the main characters are too busy making doe eyes at each other to even pay attention to what they should be doing -- namely, surviving! I mean, come on. It&#039;s just not realistic. While it is often disturbing reading what they have to do in order to survive, I&#039;d rather have the realism than too much senseless romance. 

Hey, you never know! You may have an inner Katniss! Haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooh yay! I hope you enjoy it! You make a good point about being emotionally able to survive as well; there&#039;s a psychological strain as well as a physical one and I think that part is often overlooked! There are some tough characters in dystopian stories that are just not tough in the emotional department.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I haven&#039;t read this one yet but yes it&#039;s on my TBR since I&#039;m a huge dystopian junkie!
&quot;Sometimes when I read dystopia, itâs really hard to get into the atmosphere because too many frivolous things litter the story â love triangles, insta-love, extraneous drama â all the usual suspects that make it seem like theyâre too busy being emo to actually get to the business of surviving. &quot;
Wow. You pretty much summed up how I feel about the dystopian  and post apocalyptic books these days! I don&#039;t mind books with romance in them but yes it does get tedious when the plot is focused on the romance itself. 
Great review, Paola! :)

Do I think I could survive in a post-apocalyptic or dystopian world? 
Probably not because I&#039;m no Katniss! But it all depends on the situation I guess.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m going to be reading this book for book club in the next couple of months, so glad to hear that you enjoyed it! Would I survive in a post-apocalyptic dystopia world? I guess it depends on the situation. I&#039;m not strong physically, but I think I am emotionally, so if I can put my mind to it to survive the circumstances and don&#039;t get unfortunately killed off in an accident of some sort, just maybe I could.]]></description>
