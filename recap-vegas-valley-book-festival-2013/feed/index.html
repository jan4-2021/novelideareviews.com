		<description><![CDATA[1. Obligatory repeat: I WANNA SLUMBER PARTY TOO ;A; ONE DAY, DAMN IT.

2. I got to know Charlene&#039;s dark side first hand, ok? Her Blockiness, remember??

3. THE TIDBITS FROM ALEXANDRA ON THE DARKEST MINDS, EEEEEK!1!! Good on you for being able to stay coherent. I think I would have clamped up. ;___; #NoRealLifeSocialSkills

4. WHO IS THIS CHRIS HOWARD WITH THE GREAT BRITISH ACCENT AND WHY HAVE YOU NOT MENTIONED HIM BEFORE! #SuperficialReaderAlert

There is so much awesome in this post, weeps rainbows over it. T-T And there is too much capslock in my comment but what is keyboard and coherency. I&#039;m so happy for you guys, living vicariously through y&#039;all! Glad you both had fun (and Charlene watched Mula/Pacific Rim!!! SCORE!!)! :D]]></description>
