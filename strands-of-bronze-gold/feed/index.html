		<description><![CDATA[I actually enjoyed this book quite a bit, but it had more to do with the lovely detailed writing and the villain than anything else. I agree with what you said about Sophia; it was crazy how easily manipulated she was.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is definitely polarizing and I think even more so because of the kind of relationship portrayed in the book... I would hope girls and women out there would recognize it for how abusive it is and feel as sickened as I was. Sophia is a truly terrible protagonist &amp; if she&#039;s going to be the Abolitionist Fairy she should&#039;ve at least tried to be good at it?? Just saying. If you ever want to have an exercise in how far back you can roll your eyes OR how forcefully you can throw a book against the wall, then grab this one for sure &gt;&lt;

Thanks for stopping by, Renae!! I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve met you before and it&#039;s nice to see new faces :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It caught my eye for the same reasons! I love fairytale retellings and it&#039;s so rare to see a fairytale like Bluebeard chosen for one. Sophia&#039;s relationship with her godfather is DEFINITELY creepy and I hated that she kept herself in such an abusive situation for what seemed like really superficial reasons. And yes... the human hair embroidery was just... I don&#039;t even know. I STILL don&#039;t even know and I read this book weeks ago! Super bizarre!!!

Yes, right now dear Sophia is in the running against Juliet Moreau from the Madman&#039;s Daughter, who was also ridiculous. Thanks for stopping by, Asti! I love your blog btw! &lt;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ack! This book is so polarizing, though after this review plus The Book Smugglers&#039; review, I&#039;m really thinking that I&#039;m going to be on the negative end of the review spectrum. Sophia sounds like an AWFUL protagonist, and the Abolitionist Fairy (LOL) crap would likely drive me insane. 

Unfortunately, I can see myself reading this out of morbid curiosity, if nothing else. Sigh.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, this is quite the review!  This one always catches my eye because a) oooh pretty cover! b) Bluebeard retelling and c) historical fiction.  Buuuuut I&#039;m glad that I&#039;ve never given it much more than a thought after reading your review!  I mean seriously, her grandfather sounds creepy!  And then to go from thinking that to thinking &quot;Oh no, it&#039;s okay.  I think I love him!&quot;  I just... no.  End it with the comment about her embroidering tapestries with human hair and I think I know more about this book than I ever need to.   Sorry it didn&#039;t work out for you, but at least you have a potential least favorite MC of the year candidate!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aw, I had this on my TBR list because I&#039;m interested in Bluebeard retellings, but nevermind!  I probably would have felt the same if I had to read a shallow, ineffective heroine.  Too bad.  This is a great review though! Loved your snarky turns of phrases (riding past clues on her pony LOL!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yeah the whole godfather situation was SUPER creepy and I think any self respecting woman out there would realize that immediately and be bothered by it. It REALLY bugged me that Sophia was so materialistic and shallow, plus &quot;naive&quot; (daft is a better word, good call!) and seemed to be blinded to the guy&#039;s creep factor because she was so obsessed with his wealth. Thank, I have no clue how I got through it either. Like I said, it was probably grotesque fascination later on... like hmm I wonder how much more ridic this can get?? Let&#039;s find out! Haha! 

Thanks for the comment, Charlotte &lt;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay wow that sounds ridiculous. I&#039;ve heard the heroine was pretty daft and the whole creepy godfather situation. How can she be in love with her godfather though?!? Probably more in love with how rich he is lol. Oh boy I have no idea how you managed to get through this, it sounds horrible. Kudos to you though for managing to! Sorry you didn&#039;t enjoy this more :( Thanks for the great review Paola :D]]></description>
