Of course you are. Hereâs the December 2013 forecast for <em>A Novel Idea!</em></h2>
<h3><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_blognews" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/banner_blognews.png" width="106" height="106" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Paola&#8217;s back! </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a nice long break from blogging in November while I was working on NaNoWriMo. My brain is very, very tired, but I did miss being here. I feel refreshed and ready to jump back in for the end of the year! I have so much to catch up on though &#8212; I&#8217;m pretty sure my TBR pile only managed to grow. What&#8217;s everyone been up to? What have you been reading? And for those of you who participated in NaNoWriMo with me this year, how did it go for you?? My final word count was 53,717. Translated: NOWHERE NEAR BEING FINISHED. Ahahaha. Congrats to everyone who made it to 50k, but also to everyone who joined in and gave it their best, even if you didn&#8217;t reach that count. You&#8217;re still awesome~</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Recaps or Forecasts?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So for a few months now we&#8217;ve been trying to post both an end of the month recap AND a monthly forecast telling you about upcoming highlights on the blog. The truth is, doing both is rather exhausting, even when they only have to be done once a month. Alix and I both work full time and it can be difficult to work these in, especially when the book haul can be a pretty big post. We may only keep one of these posts a month, but we&#8217;d like to ask our readers which you prefer: <em><strong>do you like recaps of what we&#8217;ve been up to all month, or do you prefer to know what&#8217;s coming up in the future??</strong></em> Please leave us a comment or hit us up on Twitter to let us know your thoughts!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3757"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scarletpimpernel.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4193" alt="scarletpimpernel" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/scarletpimpernel.jpg" width="126" height="192" /></a>New Feature: Classically Challenged (!)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow, <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion for the Austen-Challenged, Part 1" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion-for-the-austen-challenged-part-1/" target="_blank">my insane recaps of <em>Persuasion</em> by Jane Austen</a> (something we did for <a title="Classics Retold: Persuasion" href="http://novelideareviews.com/classics-retold-persuasion/" target="_blank"><em>Classics Retold</em></a> back in September) turned out to be some of our most popular posts on the blog. It seems that many of you out there share my irrational fear of reading classics! Well, good news: we&#8217;re bringing the feature back as one of our regular shenanigans, starting with a four-part recap of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240567.The_Scarlet_Pimpernel" target="_blank"><em>The Scarlet Pimpernel</em></a> by Baroness Orczy! Why this book in particular? Because I reeeaalllyyy want to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16102412-across-a-star-swept-sea?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Across a Star-Swept Sea</em></a> by Diana Peterfreund but I have to get through the original story first. Watch for the recaps every Friday this month! By the way, if you voted for my next Austen recap, the winner was <em>Emma</em> and I&#8217;ll be covering that in January :)</p>
<h3><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_events" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png" width="106" height="106" /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Round Robin Writing Project: <em>The Thirteenth Bride</em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A while ago, Tory (<a href="http://tory-san.com" target="_blank"><em>The Sleeping Latte</em></a>) and I announced a collaborative writing project and went searching for any other crazy people who might want to join us in putting together an original story from scratch, with multiple writers. Lo and behold, Daire (<a href="http://doingittheopenway.wordpress.com" target="_blank"><em>Doing It the Open Way</em></a>) was willing to be part of this crackpot scheme~ We also want to send hugs to our fourth writer, Jessylyn (<a href="http://t.co/muP2N9YfAz" target="_blank"><em>Books Over Flowers</em></a>) for everything she contributed early on in the brainstorming process &#8212; she wasn&#8217;t able to continue since she ended up super busy with school, but we loved having her!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, we promised that we&#8217;d start posting chapters in December, when the November NaNoWriMo madness was over, and we&#8217;re ready to share what we&#8217;ve come up with! Stay tuned in the next week or so for more on our project, <strong><em>The Thirteenth Bride</em></strong>. WE ARE SO EXCITED KJHSDKFH. We hope some of you decide to read it! (Even if you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll probably still be excited. No worries.)</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="banner_2PB" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_2PB.png" width="106" height="106" />#2PersonBookClub: <em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13138635-these-broken-stars?ac=1" target="_blank">These Broken Stars</a></em></strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">#2PB took a break as well in November, but we&#8217;re reconvening this month to read a book that&#8217;s been the talk of the town recently: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13138635-these-broken-stars?ac=1" target="_blank"><em>These Broken Stars</em></a> by Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner! We were lucky enough to get ARCs of the book from Disney Book Group, so many thanks to them for the opportunity to read it early and find out what all the fuss is about~ Are you curious too? Come chat with us at the end of the month when we discuss the book for #2PB!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/thesebrokenstars.jpg"><img class="alignright" alt="thesebrokenstars" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/thesebrokenstars.jpg" width="150" height="228" /></a>It&#8217;s a night like any other on board the Icarus. Then, catastrophe strikes: the massive luxury spaceliner is yanked out of hyperspace and plummets into the nearest planet. Lilac LaRoux and Tarver Merendsen survive. And they seem to be alone.</p>
<p>Lilac is the daughter of the richest man in the universe. Tarver comes from nothing, a young war hero who learned long ago that girls like Lilac are more trouble than theyâre worth. But with only each other to rely on, Lilac and Tarver must work together, making a tortuous journey across the eerie, deserted terrain to seek help.</p>
<p>Then, against all odds, Lilac and Tarver find a strange blessing in the tragedy that has thrown them into each otherâs arms. Without the hope of a future together in their own world, they begin to wonderâwould they be better off staying here forever?</p>
<p>Everything changes when they uncover the truth behind the chilling whispers that haunt their every step. Lilac and Tarver may find a way off this planet. But they wonât be the same people who landed on it.</p></blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Whatâs going on for you this month? Do you want to join us in our monthly shenanigans?? Inquiring minds want to know!</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">And don&#8217;t forget to comment and tell us if you prefer <strong>recaps/book hauls at the end of the month OR forecasts at the beginning of every month</strong>! Thanks guys!</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Hereâs a handy roundup of everything we reviewed in July! This is a feature that weâll post on the last day of every month just to reflect on the best, worst, and generally most memorable book moments we had. Starting in July, it&#8217;s also the new home of our monthly book haul as a replacement for Stacking the Shelves!</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We reviewed 17 books this month! Although that&#8217;s been a pretty consistent number for us, I feel like July was the busiest month we&#8217;ve had so far. That&#8217;s because we also hosted the awesomeness bonanza that was <a title="Welcome to Love Triangles 101! + GIVEAWAY!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/welcome-to-love-triangles-101-giveaway/"><strong>Love Triangles 101</strong></a> for a full three weeks of thoughtful, hilarious, and generally amazing posts on everyone&#8217;s favorite YA trope. If you missed it, we&#8217;ve got <a title="Love Triangles 101 Round Up" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101-round-up/">a convenient list</a> of all the excellent, enlightening reading material we were treated to during the event. You should definitely take a look! It was our first time hosting an event of this scale and we&#8217;re still floored by its success. Thank you to all our lovely blogger friends and readers who made it such a memorable month! (A must-read: <a title="Love Triangles 101: The Final Exam" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101-the-final-exam/">our &#8216;final exam&#8217; post</a> and all the hysterical responses we received!)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2817"></span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/LT_banner.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1895" alt="LT_banner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/LT_banner.png" width="392" height="71" /></a><a title="Love Triangles 101" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101/">About LT101</a> | <a title="Love Triangles 101 Round Up" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101-round-up/">Event Round-Up</a> | <a title="Love Triangles 101: The Final Exam" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101-the-final-exam/">Final Exam</a></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another reason we&#8217;ll remember July 2013: <a title="Happy Birthday, Alix!!!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/happy-birthday-alix/">Alix celebrated her birthday</a> AND got to share it with the royal baby, HRH Prince George of Cambridge! We&#8217;re huge royalty enthusiasts here at <em>A Novel Idea</em>, so we pretty much completely flipped out over this. BEST DAY EVER. In honor of the newest addition to the British royal family, we put together a list of <a title="The Royal Baby is Here!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-royal-baby-is-here/">our favorite royal reads and films</a>. In shock and awe over the media camping out in front of the hospital weeks before the birth? Pffftt. We had this post prepped like a MONTH before that. Obviously, we&#8217;re more <del>obsessed</del> dedicated.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2013 Favorites</span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paola&#8217;s Pick:</span></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds (The Darkest Minds, #1)</em></a> by Alexandra Bracken</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/thedarkestminds.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-2932" alt="thedarkestminds" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/thedarkestminds.jpg" width="120" height="182" /></a>While it may seem like I cry my face off during practically every book I read, the truth is that very few are able to get that kind of reaction from me. (I&#8217;m not actually that big of a crybaby, I swear. Err&#8230;) <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a> is definitely the kind of book that needs to have a big neon warning label on the cover so that everyone who decides to read it will be well aware of its high FBF (Facepunched By Feels) Factor. I&#8217;m so relieved that I read it just days before <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18052136-in-time" target="_blank">the e-novella</a> was released, and even more relieved that I was approved for <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16150830-never-fade" target="_blank"><em>Never Fade</em></a> on Netgalley. I honestly have no idea how I would be coping right now otherwise. That ending left me reeling! (Even though I saw it coming! UGH) Another awesome thing: Alexandra Bracken is on the list of YA authors coming to Las Vegas in November for <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a>, so I get to see her in person and I AM SO EXCITED. I highly recommend this one! <a title="The Darkest Minds" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-darkest-minds/">Read my slightly incoherent review over here</a>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alix&#8217;s Pick:</span></h3>
<p>Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have a pick this month! I know, right?! July was a pretty light reading month for me, only 5 books, and while I enjoyed most of them, none of them stood out in my memory as a &#8220;favourite&#8221; and &#8220;must recommend&#8221;. Do you ever have periods like that where it seems like book after book is just &#8220;ok&#8221;? I&#8217;m definitely going through one of those at the moment&#8230; How do you snap out of it?</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">July 2013 Book Haul</span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">July 6th was our 20th and final Stacking the Shelves post. After some deliberation and discussing it with some fellow bloggers, we decided that it was time for us to think of a new way to handle our book haul posts. While being part of the STS meme introduced us to many awesome people, it also meant a lot of meaningless comments from others who seemed to just be copy-pasting the same thing (&#8220;HEY I&#8217;VE NEVER HEARD OF ANY OF THESE BUT COME VISIT MY STS HERE -INSERT LINK-&#8221;) every week. Quality is more important than quantity, at least for us, so our book hauls are now being posted once a month.</p>
