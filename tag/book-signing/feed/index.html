		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone! Paola here, writing to you from the edge of the NaNoWriMo abyss~ I&#8217;m on hiatus this month while all this crazy novel-writing business is going on, but I really wanted to recap the awesome weekend I just had with my even more awesome friend Charlene (Bookish Whimsy) at Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013! &#8230;<br/><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read more <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>Hi everyone! Paola here, writing to you from the edge of the NaNoWriMo abyss~ I&#8217;m on hiatus this month while all this crazy novel-writing business is going on, but I really wanted to recap the awesome weekend I just had with my even more awesome friend Charlene (<a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>) at <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013</a>! So I&#8217;m stepping away from my word processor for a second to spam you with pictures and flip out over all the great authors we spotted out in the wild on Saturday. I feel like it&#8217;s my civic duty. (Also maybe I&#8217;m kinda going cross-eyed after staring at my unfinished novel for so long&#8230; err&#8230;.)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4140" alt="VVBF_010" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010-682x1024.png" width="223" height="335" /></a>I brought my fancy camera because obviously I&#8217;m a professional at this memory-making business. Pay attention. Now, we got there pretty early &#8212; like 45 mins before the first YA panel was supposed to start &#8212; and had lots of moments of serendipity such as mystically finding the parking garage when we weren&#8217;t even looking for it. This is how we knew it was meant to be. (Btw, Charlene and I had the best, most fantastic three-day slumber party EVER.) For once the weather was actually GORGEOUS in Las Vegas, something that only happens once a year when the planets align. The festival was all outdoors, so this was fortunate. We ran into our friend <a href="http://theshybooknerd.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Stacie</a>, too! She had the cutest rolling suitcase ever&#8230; girl meant business, okay?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3913"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We attended three panels; Charlene chose the first one so naturally we ended up hearing about serial killers. She has a dark side, folks. It was a GREAT panel, starring Kate Brian, Michelle Gagnon, Gretchen McNeil, Jennifer Lynn Barnes, Jessie Humphries &amp; J.R. Johansson who all discussed what it&#8217;s like to write about all things creepy. We discovered that Jennifer Lynn Barnes has an insane fear of snakes that is rivaled only by my own intense, irrational fear of insects. It was super interesting to hear how the authors got into such dark subjects and why they love writing about gritty topics versus fluff and unicorns.</p>
<div id="attachment_4146" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007.png"><img class=" wp-image-4146" alt="VVBF_007" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007-682x1024.png" width="212" height="319" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Claire Lazebnik signed a book for me to give to my beloved Alix! And her next Austen retelling is Persuasion, because this was Fate. Capital F. Did I mention this lady is awesome??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our next panel was Classical Remix, and I absolutely loved this one because my spirit animal Stacey Jay was part of it, talking about her AMAZING Beauty and the Beast retelling, <em>Of Beast &amp; Beauty</em>, which I read earlier this year and fell in love with. Except now I think I love the author more than the book! Since I&#8217;m a huge fan of retellings, it was so much fun finding out what motivated these authors to take a classic or a fairytale and twist it into something else. Among the speakers on the panel were A.G. Howard, Claire Lazebnik, Gena Showalter, and Mary Lindsey, and just about everyone agreed that retelling the original story had a lot to do with wanting to delve deeper into the characters and the plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were others who said that they chose to retell the story because they didn&#8217;t agree with how things went in the original &#8212; for example, Stacey Jay chose to write an alternate version of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet </em>(<em>Juliet Immortal</em> and <em>Romeo Redeemed</em>) because she always thought that Romeo was a massive jerk, and Claire Lazebnik had some things she disliked about Austen&#8217;s <em>Mansfield Park</em> that she was able to change up a bit in her own version, <em>The Trouble With Flirting</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4143" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002.png"><img class=" wp-image-4143" alt="VVBF_002" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002-682x1024.png" width="198" height="298" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blurry but still adorable photo of me with Kasie West&#8230; she sat down in front of me at one of the panels and I may have flipped out a little. Just a little though. I have dignity. (Errr)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and hey writer friends! Some great advice I wrote down about writing from the lovely ladies on this panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t hold yourself to some kind of accountability, the book just won&#8217;t get done.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;A character can get into trouble by coincidence, but they can&#8217;t get out of trouble by coincidence.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of those are from Eileen Cook, author of <em>Getting Revenge on Lauren Wood</em>&#8230; it&#8217;s a contemporary retelling of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>! (Awesome, right??)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And btw, there better be some confetti being thrown around right now for the fact that I actually took any notes at all, never mind that they&#8217;re extremely cryptic, half-formed sentences that I typed into my phone. I may not be as efficient and overachieving as Charlene, who actually brought a notebook because she&#8217;s like 12 billion times better at blogging than I am, but I had good intentions. LOL. If you want a rational account of this weekend&#8217;s events, you may want to head over to Bookish Whimsy. Not only did Charlene <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/2013/11/event-recap-vegas-valley-book-festival.html" target="_blank">recap the festival</a> RIGHT AWAY LIKE A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY, she also managed to not say &#8220;EEK!&#8221; and &#8220;SQUEE&#8221; nearly as often as I did. This is why I want to be her when I grow up. Ah, and she&#8217;s giving away some signed bookmarks and other assorted swag via Twitter this week, so go follow her asap!! Go go go!!</p>
<div id="attachment_4142" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001.png"><img class=" wp-image-4142 " alt="VVBF_001" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene and I with Alexandra Bracken! We are not freaking out in this picture! Aren&#8217;t you proud??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last panel was called Resurrecting the Future, and it was both the final panel of the YA portion of the festival and the last one we attended. The day was winding down, I had a mango smoothie from one of the food trucks over yonder, and life was good. It was even better because Alexandra Bracken was in this panel and we both were so excited to see/meet her at the festival! Did I mention that we spotted Alexandra walking around earlier that afternoon and got to meet her mom??? Who is the sweetest lady ever?? (Did we dream that encounter??? Hahahaha)</p>
<div id="attachment_4152" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009.png"><img class=" wp-image-4152" alt="VVBF_009" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009-682x1024.png" width="230" height="345" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene with Mary Lindsey! One of the sweetest authors we&#8217;ve ever met!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, there were other great authors on this panel, including Chris Howard and Lydia Kang. I am mentioning these two in particular right now because we discovered crazy amazing things about them at this panel. First off, Charlene and I spent the ENTIRE time being mesmerized by Chris Howard&#8217;s British accent &#8212; WE HAVE NO REGRETS. Second, Lydia Kang talked about the unique function of her blog, where she sets us straight about medical situations we might encounter while writing, such as how long a character can be stuck in the ICU. This is because she is way more accomplished than I am and is a doctor as well as an author. HELP??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For fans of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> series (like us!!!), here&#8217;s a fun fact Alexandra Bracken shared at the panel: the route that Ruby and co travel through in the books is reminiscent of the Civil War trail she and her siblings followed with their dad during a college vacation. And Liam, btw, is very much like the sweet southern boys she went to college with in Virginia. Pssst&#8230; did you know she wrote her very first book (Brightly Woven) at the age of nineteen?? Again, I am not very accomplished hahahaha /cries</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the last panel we went right to book signings! I am now going to spam you with more photos, just because I can. A huge thank you all over again to all these authors!!! I loved meeting every single one. It&#8217;s such an unbelievable experience when you love a book and then get to meet the person who brought all that awesome into your life with their words and characters. Is there anything better?? No. Well, aside from cake or something. And maybe this photo of me with Stacey Jay. *points*</p>
<div id="attachment_4141" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png"><img class=" wp-image-4141 " alt="VVBF_005_640" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png" width="640" height="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stacey Jay is my spirit animal. She decided to be a puma, specifically. I think it suits her perfectly. Also, I LOVE HER SO MUCH KSDHFKJSDF.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4144" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003.png"><img class=" wp-image-4144" alt="VVBF_003" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Gagnon actually made my day (and okay, my entire life) by recognizing me from the Dark Days Tour and Charlene from an event in LA! She came up to us and was like, OH IT&#8217;S YOU GUYS!! I died. HELP.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4145" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004.png"><img class=" wp-image-4145 " alt="VVBF_004" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Let&#8217;s play &#8220;Find Your Favorite Author!!!&#8221;</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Okay, that&#8217;s it for me tonight! Um, cause I need to go back to writing. But I love you all! I hope you enjoyed the recap! If I left out any details that you need in order to live vicariously through me, let me know. I&#8217;ll happily oblige ~ Also, I hope you&#8217;re enjoying hanging out with Alix all month!!! I happen to love her.</h3>
<h3>Thank you so much to all the sponsors and organizers of the <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year! We had a BLAST! (Um but for 2014 could you fly in Melina Marchetta so I can die happy???)</h3>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="photo_3" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a>So for <a title="Recap: Crown of Midnight Launch (Or, EEEEK)" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-crown-of-midnight-launch-or-eeeek/">my first ever author event</a>, I drove 3 hours and 40 minutes to LA for the <em>Crown of Midnight</em> launch party (also lovingly referred to around here as <em>The Explosion of Sarah Maas Fangirl Feels</em> and <em>The Time <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Charlene</a> &amp; I Turned the Entire Event Into a Melina Marchetta Flailing Session</em>) and I had a BLAST. This time, however, I only had to drive 15 minutes to the Barnes &amp; Noble near my house for the first stop on the <a href="http://www.pitchdark.com/blog/dark-days-fall-2013/" target="_blank"><strong>Fall 2013 Dark Days Tour</strong></a>! Which, of course, was an incredible experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see from this lovely poster I picked up at the bookstore, the authors on tour were special guest Tera Lynn Childs (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10429067-sweet-venom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sweet Venom</em></a>), Madeleine Roux (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597728-asylum?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Asylum</em></a>), Rae Carson (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11431896-the-bitter-kingdom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Bitter Kingdom</em></a>), Michelle Gagnon (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>), Mindy McGinnis (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13112869-not-a-drop-to-drink?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Not A Drop To Drink</em></a>) and Sherry Thomas (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332556-the-burning-sky?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The Burning Sky</em></a>). I was mainly there to fangirl incessantly over Sherry Thomas because I&#8217;d just finished reading her book on Tuesday and still hadn&#8217;t fully recovered from the awesome. I think meeting her only caused a relapse and now all I want to do is read it again, actually. You can hear me gush over it in my review <a title="The Burning Sky" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-burning-sky/">over here</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kick the event off, the authors all took some time to tell the audience about their book. Everyone volunteered Sherry Thomas to go first, so of course she completely proves my theory that we&#8217;re kindred spirits by announcing, &#8220;My book is about cross-dressing.&#8221; Which it is!!! I&#8217;m in the audience like, YES!!! *squeaking with joy*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3771"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She went on to clarify that <em>The Burning Sky</em> features a girl who dresses as a boy at Eton College in the 1800&#8242;s. She explained that she wanted to write a book that sort of had a Harry Potter vibe, but that of course the whole &#8220;magical school&#8221; thing had already been done, so she decided to go at it from a different angle. While brainstorming, she realized that in the 1800&#8242;s the only prestigious schools were for boys, which set her protagonist Iolanthe on the cross-dressing path. She compared her hero Prince Titus to Morpheus from <em>The Matrix</em> films because he&#8217;s known forever that his task is to prepare The One for her epic quest&#8230; except that in this case, her &#8220;Morpheus&#8221; discovers that &#8220;Neo&#8221; is in fact a girl. At this point I&#8217;m just giggling with glee and clutching my copy of her book to my chest cause I want to hug it forever. LOL.</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3782 alignright" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rae Carson, who just released the final installment of her <em>Girl of Fire &amp; Thorns</em> series, described her books as being full of travel, epic battles, more travel, awesome navel bling, and not your typical &#8220;skinny&#8221; heroine. Mindy McGinnis cracked me up by summing up <em>Not A Drop To Drink</em> as, &#8220;The Hunger Games meets <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, except wearing pants, and with NO unicorns or rainbows.&#8221; Um, obviously I need to read this. SOLD!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel was asked about the research they did for their books, and Michelle Gagnon shared that she actually had a real hacker go through her books to make sure everything was legit. I thought this was rather amazing. Mindy McGinnis revealed that she lives pretty much the way her main character lives; Rae Carson at this point quipped that Mindy, &#8220;shoots people from her roof.&#8221; LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Madeleine Roux, whose book takes place in a renovated asylum, talked about the often disturbing experience of going through tons and tons of photos from asylums over the course of writing. Tera Lynn Childs went to San Francisco for week-long research while writing her books &#8212; Greek mythology fans, her series is about three girls who are descended from the gorgon Medusa &#8212; and used both trips to scout out the place her characters would be living and hunting monsters in.</p>
<div id="attachment_3784" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3784" alt="photo_2" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I ran into Sara, blogger at A Nerd Girl Says, who drove 3 hours to see Rae Carson! The last time I saw her was at the Sarah Maas event, when I was the one who had driven 3 hours! Serendipity, I tell you!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of research while writing, Sherry Thomas advised that you should read and research as much as you can, but include as little of it as possible in your book. Too much research is boring! She talked about her experiences reading firsthand accounts of life at Eton College and said she could&#8217;ve gone on and on about what it&#8217;s like to be a student there BUT she took only as much as she needed to in order to set the scene for her characters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing her streak of fantastic one-liners during this panel, Sherry answered a question about snacks while writing by telling us about Deadline Cake. GUYS. DEADLINE CAKE. When her deadline comes around, she orders a 4-layer, 8-inch cake and slowly devours it over the course of a week or so. &#8220;As a meal, of course.&#8221; I DIED. CAN WE BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authors were asked if they had any fangirling experiences over other authors; Michelle Gagnon told us an embarrassing tale about meeting Stephen King and completely creeping him out! Rae Carson talked about sitting at a table across from <em>Gone Girl</em> author Gillian Flynn and trying really hard not to stare at her the entire time in pure admiration. Sherry Thomas confessed that she stalks people silently on their blogs &#8220;for their safety.&#8221; Again, I died. Not only does this woman write a book I love to death, she shares my love for cake AND is a ninja. THE END. I NEED NOTHING MORE IN THIS LIFE.</p>
<div id="attachment_3786" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3786" alt="photo_4" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me + Sherry Thomas!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the Q&amp;A with the panel, I got my books signed and squeaked my way through a conversation with Sherry Thomas when it was my turn. I asked her how she ended up going from writing romance to YA fantasy, and she replied that actually she was asked if she might want to try writing fantasy and thought it was a good idea. Yes, a very good idea, cause she totally killed it guys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I *may* have gushed like a complete moron over Prince Titus&#8230; but it&#8217;s okay cause she was like, &#8220;I LOVE HIM TOO!!&#8221; And then I got some fantastic exclusive Prince Titus trivia; apparently after she&#8217;d written the book, Sherry discovered that the name Titus actually means (okay this is not an exact quote because I was incoherent at the time due to fangirl feels), <em>&#8220;the classic Promethean hero villain who will do anything for his cause.&#8221;</em> Which is so ridiculously perfect for this character, you have no idea! I declared that this was fate. She concurred. Then I died of Awesome for the 4th or 5th time in one evening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sherry was kind enough to write the sweetest thing ever when she signed my book, AND she signed an extra copy to give away here on the blog! You lucky, lucky people! I decided that my love for <em>The Burning Sky</em> must be spread to every corner of the universe and will be giving away this signed copy PLUS a tin of homemade hand balm that Sherry made herself! I know, she just keeps getting exponentially more amazing the longer I talk about her. Seriously. So if you want to win some swag, you can enter the giveaway at the end of this post!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also got a copy of <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> by Mindy McGinnis! It was hilarious actually because when Mindy opened my book she accidentally tore the corner of the title page! But it was totally okay because now my book has a fun story behind it. I feel like the ripped page adds character. I guess she didn&#8217;t realize her own epic survivalist strength! <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_11.jpg" target="_blank">So that&#8217;s why she wrote &#8220;Oops! Sorry!&#8221; in the corner, haha.</a> I haven&#8217;t read the book yet but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. I have special swag to give away from Mindy as well, actually &#8212; watch for my review of her book in the next few weeks cause I&#8217;ll give them away then!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3787" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>I also want to point out to you guys that all the authors on the panel had these super fancy &#8220;signed by the author&#8221; stickers! Sherry made them for everyone! (What did I tell you about exponentially increasing levels of amazing??) I snapped photos of them cause I thought they were such a nice touch. Each one had their own logo specific to the author&#8217;s book. There&#8217;s a phoenix on the one for <em>The Burning Sky</em> and a drop of water for <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, ANYWAY I had a great time and just loved getting the chance to meet all these great authors! Especially Sherry Thomas. It&#8217;s so wonderful when you love an author&#8217;s book SO MUCH and then you get to meet them and you can only love them MORE. I can&#8217;t recommend her book more, truly one of my favorite 2013 releases. Want to win a signed copy?? I&#8217;m giving one away! YOU WANT THIS BOOK. TRUST ME. Because of hundreds of reasons that I am not going to elaborate on or I&#8217;ll be here rambling forever. So here&#8217;s your chance to find out for yourself!</p>
