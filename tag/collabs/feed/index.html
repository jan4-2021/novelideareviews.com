I&#8217;m also really lucky to be good friends with some lovely bloggers who have become my support system, critique group, reading buddies, and fellow cake enthusiasts over the past few months. We&#8217;re the duchesses, and we&#8217;re talking about the third and final installment of the <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10165761-quintana-of-charyn?ac=1" target="_blank"><strong>Quintana of Charyn by Melina Marchetta</strong></a>!

<h2 style="text-align: center;">WARNING: SPOILERS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Only continue reading if you&#8217;ve already finished the book, please! #WhatNeedsToBeDone</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Spoiler-Free Option</strong></span>: scroll all the way down to the bottom of this post for our feelings translated into GIFS. You&#8217;re welcome.)</h3>
<p><span id="more-4014"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which characters have you gotten the most attached to over the course of the series, and why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Oh easy, EVERYONE. Â Well. Â If I canât say thatâ¦ I should say Beatriss and Trevanion because I love their story and they are wonderful characters, but honestly over the course of the whole series, the character that makes me the happiest because he changed so much is Froi. Â To have him start with nothing, to be so reviled in the beginning and just look at him in the end. Â Itâs the biggest character arc, and the fact that heâs conflicted over which country he belongs to, and how he honors the three women who mean the most to him is so touching. Â And that darkness in him thatâs just hovering &#8211; itâs interesting how he overcomes it step by step.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Lucien and Phaedra, they really started to grow on me when I was reading Froi of the Exiles and just seeing them together. Then in Quintana of Charyn they just utterly destroyed me, we only catch glimpses of Lucien and Phaedra which just makes me love them even more because the less Marchetta gives me of Lucien and Phaedra, the more I crave! But I also really loved Froi and Quintana, their relationship is unique and both are quite peculiar by themselves but they fit so well together like two puzzle pieces made for each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is Isaboe for me, hands down. I just love her. I love her even when sheâs not at her most loveable. Of course, Iâve felt this way about her since the first book, so no one should be surprised at my answer! Truthfully, I have a soft spot for just about everybody in this series. The most surprising thing for me was how much I ended up loving Froiâ¦ since all my attention was devoted to Finnikin and Evanjalin in the first book, he completely came out of nowhere for me in the second book; I didnât realize how much I would come to love him as a character and how complex he would end up being.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Lucian. He was just a Mont boy whose father died too abruptly that he had to grow up too fast, too soon and in such difficult conditions. Everyone was expecting him to be great and he was just under such tremendous stress. He was trying so hard to follow his head but his heart wouldnât and it was such a frustrating mess of emotions in him. He tried so damn hard to hide his feelings too that I canât help but gravitate towards both empathizing and sympathizing him. At one point, I just wanted everyone to GET OFF HIS BACK ALREADY, CANâT YOU SEE HEâS TRYING. Yup, too invested right there.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Did you have any predictions regarding events in the last book? Did any of those predictions come true?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I predicted it would be a happy ending in an emotionally satisfying way. Â I would absolutely never pick up these books again if the ending let me down and I didnât get a happy resolution!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: It was going to be a total emotional rollercoaster thatâs for sure and IT WAS. Just all my feels pouring out of me like pouring water out, at the end I was in a complete book hangover.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Yes, I predicted I would weep like a complete moron and I did. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: I read blind most of the time so I have barely any predictions. I did not expect an ending with such highly charged emotions though, I was being led falsely into believing it would be a heart-wrenching tragic ending. (Yes, me and my angst. Weeps.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">How did you feel about the ending??</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: That epilogue man!! It was snapshot after snapshot of the most gorgeously emotional scenes! Â Of love and happiness and hope and joy. Â I mean, it was just perfection!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END?? I mean it was so satisfying but I WANT MORE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: It was so, so, SO satisfying &#8212; I can recall few other books that have left me feeling so overwhelmingly content. I was laughing and crying for a thousand different reasons. I prefer to have closure when I finish a book and this definitely delivered on that. My only regret concerning this ending was the fact that it had to end at all. I just want it to keep going, on and on. Maybe Melina could tweet me random updates on the charactersâ lives?? âWell guys, Jasmina stole the mail again!â âGuess what? Little Tariq started walking today!!â et al etc. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Extremely satisfied. Hell, I think I was already satisfied when I read about Luci-en and Phaedra. (Is this too spoilery? Ahâ¦)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">DID YOU CRY???</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I cried throughout &#8211; little unexpected tearing up at all the moments when it looked like things might go wrong and suddenly went right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: I wanted to but the tears wouldnât come out lol. It was mainly all internal crying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: NOT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IN DEPTH CAUSE ITâS EMBARRASSING</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Iâ¦ didnât. I was more of YES EVERYONE LETâS CELEBRATE!!! THIS CALLS FOR THE MOST GRAND FEAST IN ALL OF CHARYN AND LUMATERE! (Polar opposites from Paola, lmao. STILL!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">What events in the book gave you the ultimate punch of feels?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion (Thatâs a popular one!) Isaboe losing her child and how Finnikin supported her through that. Â And later how the Monts tried to be happy when Isaboe came to visit so she can have their joy. Â Froi and Quintanaâs reunion for just a moment before they took her away. Â And also when Finnikin and Lord August want to adopt Froi so he can have a title. Â Oh and all the scenes in Chapters 1-49 with Epilogue.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion!!! Super tense and I was screaming from all the feels. Also that scene with Lucien and Phaedra (youâll probably know what Iâm talking about when you read it), THAT ONE LINE DESTROYED ME. Also the events at Charyn towards the end, I never saw it coming but it made me so happy!!!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Omgâ¦ what DIDNâT result in a feels facepunch here??? I think the top three moments that just completely did me in were: 1) when Froi thought he was going to die for sure and Finnikin appeared for the BEST BRO MOMENT EVER IN HISTORY; 2) when Froi and Quintana were reunited and I just kjahfkjhfkshdf DIED; 3) at the end when Finn, Froi and Lucian brought the story back full circle by vowing to be BFFs for life. Runner up: when Quintana opened the gift from Isaboe and it was that same ruby ring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">â¦ Okay, writing all that down just made my heart start aching all over again &gt;&lt;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Beatriss and Trevanionâs âNeed To Talkâ moment. Also, Perri and Tesadoraâs moment of breaking down as they talk about their past losses. Vestieâs meeting âKintanaâ. Lucian and Phaedraâs heated moment(s) of truth tops everything for me, complete with ~swiving~ and everything. There are so many but these are only some off the top of my head. :â)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which character(s) do you think went through the most growth in the series?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well Froi for me with how much he has gained from having friends and family and a purpose. Â And also Quintana &#8211; I was really touched by how much she cared for the girls who took care of her in her pregnancy when it seemed like they all could barely stand each other. Â It makes me hopeful about the people I canât stand in my life. LOL Â But seriously, Quintana is such a prickly character that seeing her opening up and having compassion just makes me want to cry for some reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Hmmm I want to say Froi but I think he did most of the growing back in the previous book. I think each and every character had a bit of growth here and there, there wasnât anyone in particular that grew the the most because most of the development happened in the previous two books. But if I really have to choose one I would say Phaedra, sheâs gone through a lot of change and really has grown quite a bit even in this book.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is a tie between Froi and Lucian for me. Froi just made these huge leaps and bounds in character development and all of it slapped me in the face in Book 2. How was this the same Froi??? And then Lucian! I thought he was going to be a minor character based on his minimal involvement with the first book but HOLY MOLY. From having to take over as leader of the Monts when his father died to the heart-crushing Lucian/Phaedra feels, he became so much more than I ever imagined.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Who the hell didnât grow in this series, sob. May I say Lucian again? For all the reasons heâs my favourite character in the first place. *weeps tears of rainbow*</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>
