<h2 style="text-align: center;">WARNING: SPOILERS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Only continue reading if you&#8217;ve already finished the book, please! #WhatNeedsToBeDone</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Spoiler-Free Option</strong></span>: scroll all the way down to the bottom of this post for our feelings translated into GIFS. You&#8217;re welcome.)</h3>
<p><span id="more-4014"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which characters have you gotten the most attached to over the course of the series, and why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Oh easy, EVERYONE. Â Well. Â If I canât say thatâ¦ I should say Beatriss and Trevanion because I love their story and they are wonderful characters, but honestly over the course of the whole series, the character that makes me the happiest because he changed so much is Froi. Â To have him start with nothing, to be so reviled in the beginning and just look at him in the end. Â Itâs the biggest character arc, and the fact that heâs conflicted over which country he belongs to, and how he honors the three women who mean the most to him is so touching. Â And that darkness in him thatâs just hovering &#8211; itâs interesting how he overcomes it step by step.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Lucien and Phaedra, they really started to grow on me when I was reading Froi of the Exiles and just seeing them together. Then in Quintana of Charyn they just utterly destroyed me, we only catch glimpses of Lucien and Phaedra which just makes me love them even more because the less Marchetta gives me of Lucien and Phaedra, the more I crave! But I also really loved Froi and Quintana, their relationship is unique and both are quite peculiar by themselves but they fit so well together like two puzzle pieces made for each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is Isaboe for me, hands down. I just love her. I love her even when sheâs not at her most loveable. Of course, Iâve felt this way about her since the first book, so no one should be surprised at my answer! Truthfully, I have a soft spot for just about everybody in this series. The most surprising thing for me was how much I ended up loving Froiâ¦ since all my attention was devoted to Finnikin and Evanjalin in the first book, he completely came out of nowhere for me in the second book; I didnât realize how much I would come to love him as a character and how complex he would end up being.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Lucian. He was just a Mont boy whose father died too abruptly that he had to grow up too fast, too soon and in such difficult conditions. Everyone was expecting him to be great and he was just under such tremendous stress. He was trying so hard to follow his head but his heart wouldnât and it was such a frustrating mess of emotions in him. He tried so damn hard to hide his feelings too that I canât help but gravitate towards both empathizing and sympathizing him. At one point, I just wanted everyone to GET OFF HIS BACK ALREADY, CANâT YOU SEE HEâS TRYING. Yup, too invested right there.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Did you have any predictions regarding events in the last book? Did any of those predictions come true?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I predicted it would be a happy ending in an emotionally satisfying way. Â I would absolutely never pick up these books again if the ending let me down and I didnât get a happy resolution!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: It was going to be a total emotional rollercoaster thatâs for sure and IT WAS. Just all my feels pouring out of me like pouring water out, at the end I was in a complete book hangover.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Yes, I predicted I would weep like a complete moron and I did. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: I read blind most of the time so I have barely any predictions. I did not expect an ending with such highly charged emotions though, I was being led falsely into believing it would be a heart-wrenching tragic ending. (Yes, me and my angst. Weeps.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">How did you feel about the ending??</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: That epilogue man!! It was snapshot after snapshot of the most gorgeously emotional scenes! Â Of love and happiness and hope and joy. Â I mean, it was just perfection!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END?? I mean it was so satisfying but I WANT MORE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: It was so, so, SO satisfying &#8212; I can recall few other books that have left me feeling so overwhelmingly content. I was laughing and crying for a thousand different reasons. I prefer to have closure when I finish a book and this definitely delivered on that. My only regret concerning this ending was the fact that it had to end at all. I just want it to keep going, on and on. Maybe Melina could tweet me random updates on the charactersâ lives?? âWell guys, Jasmina stole the mail again!â âGuess what? Little Tariq started walking today!!â et al etc. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Extremely satisfied. Hell, I think I was already satisfied when I read about Luci-en and Phaedra. (Is this too spoilery? Ahâ¦)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">DID YOU CRY???</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I cried throughout &#8211; little unexpected tearing up at all the moments when it looked like things might go wrong and suddenly went right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: I wanted to but the tears wouldnât come out lol. It was mainly all internal crying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: NOT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IN DEPTH CAUSE ITâS EMBARRASSING</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Iâ¦ didnât. I was more of YES EVERYONE LETâS CELEBRATE!!! THIS CALLS FOR THE MOST GRAND FEAST IN ALL OF CHARYN AND LUMATERE! (Polar opposites from Paola, lmao. STILL!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">What events in the book gave you the ultimate punch of feels?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion (Thatâs a popular one!) Isaboe losing her child and how Finnikin supported her through that. Â And later how the Monts tried to be happy when Isaboe came to visit so she can have their joy. Â Froi and Quintanaâs reunion for just a moment before they took her away. Â And also when Finnikin and Lord August want to adopt Froi so he can have a title. Â Oh and all the scenes in Chapters 1-49 with Epilogue.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion!!! Super tense and I was screaming from all the feels. Also that scene with Lucien and Phaedra (youâll probably know what Iâm talking about when you read it), THAT ONE LINE DESTROYED ME. Also the events at Charyn towards the end, I never saw it coming but it made me so happy!!!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Omgâ¦ what DIDNâT result in a feels facepunch here??? I think the top three moments that just completely did me in were: 1) when Froi thought he was going to die for sure and Finnikin appeared for the BEST BRO MOMENT EVER IN HISTORY; 2) when Froi and Quintana were reunited and I just kjahfkjhfkshdf DIED; 3) at the end when Finn, Froi and Lucian brought the story back full circle by vowing to be BFFs for life. Runner up: when Quintana opened the gift from Isaboe and it was that same ruby ring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">â¦ Okay, writing all that down just made my heart start aching all over again &gt;&lt;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Beatriss and Trevanionâs âNeed To Talkâ moment. Also, Perri and Tesadoraâs moment of breaking down as they talk about their past losses. Vestieâs meeting âKintanaâ. Lucian and Phaedraâs heated moment(s) of truth tops everything for me, complete with ~swiving~ and everything. There are so many but these are only some off the top of my head. :â)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which character(s) do you think went through the most growth in the series?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well Froi for me with how much he has gained from having friends and family and a purpose. Â And also Quintana &#8211; I was really touched by how much she cared for the girls who took care of her in her pregnancy when it seemed like they all could barely stand each other. Â It makes me hopeful about the people I canât stand in my life. LOL Â But seriously, Quintana is such a prickly character that seeing her opening up and having compassion just makes me want to cry for some reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Hmmm I want to say Froi but I think he did most of the growing back in the previous book. I think each and every character had a bit of growth here and there, there wasnât anyone in particular that grew the the most because most of the development happened in the previous two books. But if I really have to choose one I would say Phaedra, sheâs gone through a lot of change and really has grown quite a bit even in this book.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is a tie between Froi and Lucian for me. Froi just made these huge leaps and bounds in character development and all of it slapped me in the face in Book 2. How was this the same Froi??? And then Lucian! I thought he was going to be a minor character based on his minimal involvement with the first book but HOLY MOLY. From having to take over as leader of the Monts when his father died to the heart-crushing Lucian/Phaedra feels, he became so much more than I ever imagined.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Who the hell didnât grow in this series, sob. May I say Lucian again? For all the reasons heâs my favourite character in the first place. *weeps tears of rainbow*</p>
