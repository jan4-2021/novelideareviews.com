Paola here, writing to you from the edge of the NaNoWriMo abyss~ I&#8217;m on hiatus this month while all this crazy novel-writing business is going on, but I really wanted to recap the awesome weekend I just had with my even more awesome friend Charlene (Bookish Whimsy) at Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013! &#8230;<br/><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read more <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>Hi everyone! Paola here, writing to you from the edge of the NaNoWriMo abyss~ I&#8217;m on hiatus this month while all this crazy novel-writing business is going on, but I really wanted to recap the awesome weekend I just had with my even more awesome friend Charlene (<a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>) at <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013</a>! So I&#8217;m stepping away from my word processor for a second to spam you with pictures and flip out over all the great authors we spotted out in the wild on Saturday. I feel like it&#8217;s my civic duty. (Also maybe I&#8217;m kinda going cross-eyed after staring at my unfinished novel for so long&#8230; err&#8230;.)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4140" alt="VVBF_010" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010-682x1024.png" width="223" height="335" /></a>I brought my fancy camera because obviously I&#8217;m a professional at this memory-making business. Pay attention. Now, we got there pretty early &#8212; like 45 mins before the first YA panel was supposed to start &#8212; and had lots of moments of serendipity such as mystically finding the parking garage when we weren&#8217;t even looking for it. This is how we knew it was meant to be. (Btw, Charlene and I had the best, most fantastic three-day slumber party EVER.) For once the weather was actually GORGEOUS in Las Vegas, something that only happens once a year when the planets align. The festival was all outdoors, so this was fortunate. We ran into our friend <a href="http://theshybooknerd.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Stacie</a>, too! She had the cutest rolling suitcase ever&#8230; girl meant business, okay?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3913"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We attended three panels; Charlene chose the first one so naturally we ended up hearing about serial killers. She has a dark side, folks. It was a GREAT panel, starring Kate Brian, Michelle Gagnon, Gretchen McNeil, Jennifer Lynn Barnes, Jessie Humphries &amp; J.R. Johansson who all discussed what it&#8217;s like to write about all things creepy. We discovered that Jennifer Lynn Barnes has an insane fear of snakes that is rivaled only by my own intense, irrational fear of insects. It was super interesting to hear how the authors got into such dark subjects and why they love writing about gritty topics versus fluff and unicorns.</p>
<div id="attachment_4146" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007.png"><img class=" wp-image-4146" alt="VVBF_007" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007-682x1024.png" width="212" height="319" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Claire Lazebnik signed a book for me to give to my beloved Alix! And her next Austen retelling is Persuasion, because this was Fate. Capital F. Did I mention this lady is awesome??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our next panel was Classical Remix, and I absolutely loved this one because my spirit animal Stacey Jay was part of it, talking about her AMAZING Beauty and the Beast retelling, <em>Of Beast &amp; Beauty</em>, which I read earlier this year and fell in love with. Except now I think I love the author more than the book! Since I&#8217;m a huge fan of retellings, it was so much fun finding out what motivated these authors to take a classic or a fairytale and twist it into something else. Among the speakers on the panel were A.G. Howard, Claire Lazebnik, Gena Showalter, and Mary Lindsey, and just about everyone agreed that retelling the original story had a lot to do with wanting to delve deeper into the characters and the plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were others who said that they chose to retell the story because they didn&#8217;t agree with how things went in the original &#8212; for example, Stacey Jay chose to write an alternate version of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet </em>(<em>Juliet Immortal</em> and <em>Romeo Redeemed</em>) because she always thought that Romeo was a massive jerk, and Claire Lazebnik had some things she disliked about Austen&#8217;s <em>Mansfield Park</em> that she was able to change up a bit in her own version, <em>The Trouble With Flirting</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4143" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002.png"><img class=" wp-image-4143" alt="VVBF_002" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002-682x1024.png" width="198" height="298" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blurry but still adorable photo of me with Kasie West&#8230; she sat down in front of me at one of the panels and I may have flipped out a little. Just a little though. I have dignity. (Errr)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and hey writer friends! Some great advice I wrote down about writing from the lovely ladies on this panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t hold yourself to some kind of accountability, the book just won&#8217;t get done.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;A character can get into trouble by coincidence, but they can&#8217;t get out of trouble by coincidence.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of those are from Eileen Cook, author of <em>Getting Revenge on Lauren Wood</em>&#8230; it&#8217;s a contemporary retelling of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>! (Awesome, right??)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And btw, there better be some confetti being thrown around right now for the fact that I actually took any notes at all, never mind that they&#8217;re extremely cryptic, half-formed sentences that I typed into my phone. I may not be as efficient and overachieving as Charlene, who actually brought a notebook because she&#8217;s like 12 billion times better at blogging than I am, but I had good intentions. LOL. If you want a rational account of this weekend&#8217;s events, you may want to head over to Bookish Whimsy. Not only did Charlene <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/2013/11/event-recap-vegas-valley-book-festival.html" target="_blank">recap the festival</a> RIGHT AWAY LIKE A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY, she also managed to not say &#8220;EEK!&#8221; and &#8220;SQUEE&#8221; nearly as often as I did. This is why I want to be her when I grow up. Ah, and she&#8217;s giving away some signed bookmarks and other assorted swag via Twitter this week, so go follow her asap!! Go go go!!</p>
<div id="attachment_4142" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001.png"><img class=" wp-image-4142 " alt="VVBF_001" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene and I with Alexandra Bracken! We are not freaking out in this picture! Aren&#8217;t you proud??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last panel was called Resurrecting the Future, and it was both the final panel of the YA portion of the festival and the last one we attended. The day was winding down, I had a mango smoothie from one of the food trucks over yonder, and life was good. It was even better because Alexandra Bracken was in this panel and we both were so excited to see/meet her at the festival! Did I mention that we spotted Alexandra walking around earlier that afternoon and got to meet her mom??? Who is the sweetest lady ever?? (Did we dream that encounter??? Hahahaha)</p>
<div id="attachment_4152" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009.png"><img class=" wp-image-4152" alt="VVBF_009" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009-682x1024.png" width="230" height="345" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene with Mary Lindsey! One of the sweetest authors we&#8217;ve ever met!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, there were other great authors on this panel, including Chris Howard and Lydia Kang. I am mentioning these two in particular right now because we discovered crazy amazing things about them at this panel. First off, Charlene and I spent the ENTIRE time being mesmerized by Chris Howard&#8217;s British accent &#8212; WE HAVE NO REGRETS. Second, Lydia Kang talked about the unique function of her blog, where she sets us straight about medical situations we might encounter while writing, such as how long a character can be stuck in the ICU. This is because she is way more accomplished than I am and is a doctor as well as an author. HELP??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For fans of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> series (like us!!!), here&#8217;s a fun fact Alexandra Bracken shared at the panel: the route that Ruby and co travel through in the books is reminiscent of the Civil War trail she and her siblings followed with their dad during a college vacation. And Liam, btw, is very much like the sweet southern boys she went to college with in Virginia. Pssst&#8230; did you know she wrote her very first book (Brightly Woven) at the age of nineteen?? Again, I am not very accomplished hahahaha /cries</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the last panel we went right to book signings! I am now going to spam you with more photos, just because I can. A huge thank you all over again to all these authors!!! I loved meeting every single one. It&#8217;s such an unbelievable experience when you love a book and then get to meet the person who brought all that awesome into your life with their words and characters. Is there anything better?? No. Well, aside from cake or something. And maybe this photo of me with Stacey Jay. *points*</p>
<div id="attachment_4141" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png"><img class=" wp-image-4141 " alt="VVBF_005_640" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png" width="640" height="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stacey Jay is my spirit animal. She decided to be a puma, specifically. I think it suits her perfectly. Also, I LOVE HER SO MUCH KSDHFKJSDF.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4144" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003.png"><img class=" wp-image-4144" alt="VVBF_003" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Gagnon actually made my day (and okay, my entire life) by recognizing me from the Dark Days Tour and Charlene from an event in LA! She came up to us and was like, OH IT&#8217;S YOU GUYS!! I died. HELP.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4145" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004.png"><img class=" wp-image-4145 " alt="VVBF_004" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Let&#8217;s play &#8220;Find Your Favorite Author!!!&#8221;</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Okay, that&#8217;s it for me tonight! Um, cause I need to go back to writing. But I love you all! I hope you enjoyed the recap! If I left out any details that you need in order to live vicariously through me, let me know. I&#8217;ll happily oblige ~ Also, I hope you&#8217;re enjoying hanging out with Alix all month!!! I happen to love her.</h3>
<h3>Thank you so much to all the sponsors and organizers of the <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year! We had a BLAST! (Um but for 2014 could you fly in Melina Marchetta so I can die happy???)</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_3448" style="width: 196px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3448" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-232x300.jpg" width="186" height="240" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I paused to take a photo in between hugging the book and sobbing.

<p style="text-align: justify;">OKAY, EVERYONE CALM DOWN NOW. SERIOUSLY. Oh, it&#8217;s just me still walking around squeaking incoherently and having to take deep yoga breaths every few minutes? Ah. Okay. Well, fine then. I guess I&#8217;ll pull myself together and write this post now. Errr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahem. SO! On Tuesday afternoon I embarked on a 3 hour and 48 minute drive from Las Vegas, NV to La Verne, CA so I could be there for the <em>Crown of Midnight</em> launch party at Mrs. Nelson&#8217;s Books. I can&#8217;t even articulate how ridiculously excited I was for this to happen. I mean, I&#8217;ve been writhing in agony and pretty much dying to get my hands on the book for months now. (Some of you may still remember the tragic moment when I was rejected for the ARC on Netgalley and subsequently spiraled into despair for days afterward &#8212; especially since the rejection was horrifically timed right before my birthday&#8230; *starts crying again just remembering this*)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But wait! There were two other huge, hysteria-inducing reasons for my excitement: 1) of course, Sarah J. Maas was going to be there and I MIGHT ACTUALLY GET TO SPEAK WITH HERÂ  and 2) one of my most fabulous bookish friends, Charlene from <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>, was going to be there too! Um, yeah, indulge in a mini freak-out with me real fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3447"></span></p>
<div id="attachment_3452" style="width: 190px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo5.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3452" alt="photo5" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo5-300x300.jpg" width="180" height="180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Our giant pile of books waiting to be signed (with Finnikin thrown in for good measure haha)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Needless to say, from the moment I arrived at the bookstore I was in a state of pure, undeniable, all caps EEEEEEKKKK. I&#8217;m not kidding. My brain was just one long string of EEEEKKKKKK for pretty much the entire night. It went a lot like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I found Charlene in the bookstore and we hugged and flailed around &#8212; EEEEKKKK</li>
<li>There was chocolate cake (Charlene got to it ASAP, guys. Don&#8217;t mess with this girl and the cake.)Â  &#8212; EEEEEKKKK</li>
<li>I picked up a gorgeous hardcover copy of <em>Crown of Midnight</em> &#8212; EEEEEEKKK</li>
<li>I realized that fellow blogger &amp; recent Twitter acquaintance <a href="http://t.co/SirTU3y4Jj" target="_blank">Stacie</a> was also there &#8212; EEEEEEKKKK</li>
<li>Sarah J. Maas arrived and was waving to everyone &#8212; EEEEEKKKKKK</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_3453" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo6.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3453 " alt="photo6" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo6-300x300.jpg" width="210" height="210" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene &amp; I :D</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And so on, et al etc, for like 3 hours. The level of Awesomeness only escalated while Sarah was talking about how she got published and the story behind the <em>Throne of Glass</em> series. Right off the bat she mentioned both Robin McKinley AND Garth Nix as inspirations while she was dreaming of becoming a published writer from the time she was in high school &#8212; that&#8217;s right, two of my absolute favorite authors of all time. (Just picture me in my seat flipping out and essentially wanting to wave a sign saying SARAH WE ARE KINDRED SPIRITS.) She went on to answer some questions about her upcoming New Adult series, scheduled for 2015 publication, which isÂ  going to be a fantasy based on <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em> and <em>Tam Lin</em>. (I already knew about the series coming out, but picture me freaking out over it anyway at this point.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then, someone raised their hand and asked Sarah what kind of books she reads when she isn&#8217;t busy writing. This, my friends, is when the levels of Awesomeness completely transcended all previous possible limits, because Sarah answered that she&#8217;s a huge Melina Marchetta fan. She told us about meeting Melina at Comic-Con last year and just being utterly overwhelmed by the experience, all while Charlene and I were high-fiving and essentially dying of joy in the third row. Sarah confessed that she actually hadn&#8217;t even started the third book yet because she wasn&#8217;t sure she could handle the feels, and I couldn&#8217;t resist chiming in that we were in the same boat. This kind of derailed the rest of the conversation as we veered into Finnikin fangirling territory. It went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Us: &#8220;OMG WE HAVEN&#8217;T READ QUINTANA OF CHARYN YET EITHER. We decided to read it together for the moral support!!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sarah: &#8220;OMG YOU GUYS ARE MY SPIRIT ANIMALS&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Us: &#8220;OMG HELP THAT JUST MADE MY ENTIRE LIFE EEEEKKKK&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rest of the room: &#8230;..?????</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys. I just. I can&#8217;t even. Askahfdkjahsdfkjhakshdfkjsdhf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were the last to get our books signed, which was probably a good thing since this process took some time to get through. Sarah was amazing throughout the entire book launch, by the way. I didn&#8217;t think I could love this author any more than I already do, but I LOVE HER SO MUCH. It was my first ever book signing and I&#8217;m so glad this is the author I got to see. She was super funny, fangirled over Finnikin with us, and patiently signed everything we&#8217;d brought. She also wrote in our copies of <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> (all the while saying SORRY MELINA!!! and squeaking while saying she couldn&#8217;t believe she was &#8220;defacing&#8221; a Melina Marchetta book hahaha) and took a photo with us. BEST DAY EVER AAAHHHH.</p>
<div id="attachment_3455" style="width: 532px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signedbooks.png"><img class=" wp-image-3455" alt="signedbooks" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/signedbooks.png" width="522" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">She had to sign her name really small on my copy of Throne of Glass because we were both saying EEEEE and she wrote it all over the page before signing!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was such an incredible experience. Seriously. I feel like I could babble on and on about it forever. Sarah was already a favorite author of mine and it was almost overwhelming getting to meet her and finding out how warm, approachable, and AMAZING she is in person. Plus I got to meet Charlene!!!! AAAHHH!!! The funny thing is that even though we&#8217;d never actually met before, I already felt like we&#8217;d known each other forever because of Twitter and email and our blogs. So it was a lot like seeing an old friend. I laughed so much my face hurt.</p>
<div id="attachment_3457" style="width: 482px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo7.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3457" alt="photo7" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo7-1024x793.jpg" width="472" height="365" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">LOL my glasses were falling off my face and you can&#8217;t see my eyes!! I look like this: ^__^ OH WELL IT DOESN&#8217;T MATTER BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST DAY EVER</p></div>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">THANK YOU SO MUCH SARAH!!!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head over to Bookish Whimsy today to check out <a href="http://t.co/GdlAXg4WG7" target="_blank">Charlene&#8217;s recap of the event</a>, which will probably be much more dignified than mine, haha. You should be immensely jealous that I got to talk about cake and <em>The Little Mermaid</em> with her!!! I just finished <em>Crown of Midnight</em> yesterday (I went on a total binge and accomplished nothing else) so watch for my review coming soon. In the meantime, I wrote a guest post for the <em>Throne of Glass</em> tribute over at Ink Shelves, which will be up on their blog this coming Sunday! You can go hear me wax poetic about Celaena Sardothien, who is MY spirit animal. (Well, one of them. The other is Isaboe of Lumatere, obviously.)</p>

Of course you are. Here&#8217;s the August forecast for <em>A Novel Idea!</em></h3>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_comingsoon.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3118" alt="banner_comingsoon" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_comingsoon.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Novel Idea Turns 5!</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Believe it or not, this little corner of the internet has been around since 2008! For the first four years of its existence, <em>A Novel Idea</em> was more of a personal blog and I never promoted it as a full-fledged book blog. And then I decided to come back and make book blogging a bigger part of my life, which is honestly one of the best decisions I&#8217;ve ever made. Thanks to this blog, I&#8217;ve met so many amazing people, become better friends with my fabulous co-blogger Alix, and now I pretty much ALWAYS have someone to talk about books with! <strong>In honor of our 5th birthday, we&#8217;re unveiling a shiny redesign of the blog on Monday, August 5th.</strong> We hope you find some time to stop by and tell us what you think! (Psst&#8230; we may be giving away some books&#8230;) While we&#8217;re on the subject, if we&#8217;re down for maintenance a lot over the next few days, don&#8217;t panic. AWESOMENESS IS HAPPENING.</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_ARCqueue.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-3117 alignleft" alt="banner_ARCqueue" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_ARCqueue.png" width="106" height="106" /></a></p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">August ARCs</span></h4>
<p dir="ltr">August is packed with quite a few exciting new releases, some of which we were lucky enough to read and review in advance! Here are some future reviews to look forward to:</p>
<ul>

<h4><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3119" alt="banner_events" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_events.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Gasp! A collaboration with Gypsy Reviews!</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, so excited to announce an upcoming collab with our very good friend (and Paola&#8217;s book twin) Charlotte over at <a title="Gypsy Reviews" href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Gypsy Reviews</a>! We won&#8217;t say anything more about it, except that at some point there will most likely be a long treatise on why Mulan is a Certified Badass. (Duh.) Charlotte is currently on hiatus, but if you aren&#8217;t already following her blog&#8230; YOU SHOULD BE. I sense she&#8217;ll be back with a vengeance ;D The event is scheduled for August 20-22 so stay tuned!!</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3120" alt="banner_cantwait" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/banner_cantwait.png" width="106" height="106" /></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Our August Wishlist</span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don&#8217;t do Waiting on Wednesday posts, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re any less covetous than the rest. Here are two books we&#8217;re dying to get our hands on this month! (Paola&#8217;s shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone&#8230;) What about you? Are you looking forward to these too??</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_alixpick.png"><img class="wp-image-3224 alignright" alt="august_alixpick" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_alixpick.png" width="120" height="181" /></a>Alix&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15768463-the-passion-of-the-purple-plumeria" target="_blank"><em>The Passion of the Purple Plumeria (Pink Carnation, #10)</em></a> by Lauren Willig</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I adore the Pink Carnation series by Lauren Willig! I read the first 8 books in over the span of 2 months and have ever since been not so patiently waiting for a new book in the series year. Set in England during the Napoleonic wars, the Pink Carnation series follows the various hijinks of delightful characters who are all in one way or another involved in spying for Her Majesty. Funny, witty, smart and just overall wonderful, I cannot recommend this series enough and am SUPER EXCITED for âThe Passion of the Purple Plumeriaâ!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_paolapick.png"><img class="wp-image-3225 alignright" alt="august_paolapick" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/august_paolapick.png" width="120" height="180" /></a>Paola&#8217;s Pick: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17167166-crown-of-midnight" target="_blank"><em>Crown of Midnight (Throne of Glass, #2)</em></a> by Sarah J. Maas</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What, I told you it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise! Although I have yet to fully recover from getting rejected for the ARC on Netgalley two days before my birthday (thanks Charlotte and Alix for comforting me during my spiral into despair), I just found out Sarah J. Maas will be in L.A. for her U.S. book tour&#8230; AND I&#8217;M TOTALLY DRIVING OVER THERE!!! It&#8217;s about 4 hours away from Vegas. Plus, WORTH IT. Is anyone else going?? I&#8217;m planning to attend her signing on August 27th! If you see a crazy girl in the corner flailing her arms and sobbing into her copy of <em>Throne of Glass</em>, it&#8217;s probably me. Additional clue: there will probably be a fairly exasperated guy standing at a safe distance, wondering why he married me and subsequently found himself dragged to Los Angeles so I can fulfill a lifelong dream. HAHA. TOUGH BREAKS, HUSBAND.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">What&#8217;s going on in your world this month? Do tell!</h3>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a title="Welcome to Love Triangles 101! + GIVEAWAY!" href="http://novelideareviews.com/welcome-to-love-triangles-101-giveaway/">Intro + Giveaway</a> | <a title="Love Triangles 101 Event Schedule" href="http://novelideareviews.com/love-triangles-101-event-schedule/">Event Schedule</a></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s been an amazing three weeks of Love Triangles 101! We&#8217;re starting to sound like a broken record, but THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who participated, whether you were one of our LT101 &#8216;guest lecturers&#8217; or studiously taking notes in the back of the room ;D Today is the last day of the event and it&#8217;s crazy how quickly time flew by. We were treated to so many thoughtful (and hilarious) posts and discussions! You can still enter our giveaway, which ends at midnight, and we&#8217;ll also have a full round-up of all the posts so that you can catch up on anything you missed!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But first, there&#8217;s the final exam. Well, and a fun little prize too. No pain, no gain!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(&#8230;Oh, don&#8217;t look so surprised. Paola&#8217;s a teacher, OF COURSE there&#8217;s a final exam. That, and we&#8217;re both slightly diabolical in nature.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keep reading to find out what you need to do for an A+ in Love Triangles 101&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we have provided a super fancy triangular diagram that will no doubt give you terrible flashbacks of A) geometry class <del>or B) <em>Twilight</em></del>. This diagram is a love triangle we came up with to test your love triangle expertise, which we have complete faith in. We know you can do this. You&#8217;ve spent three weeks preparing! More than that, if you read lots of YA. So don&#8217;t stress! We&#8217;ve even provided certain dramatic details to increase your knowledge and boost creativity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All you have to do is tell us how you think this love triangle should be resolved.</strong></span> Will it end in flames? Will it drown in tears? Will our characters be crushed by the dramavalanche?? (&lt;&#8211; Borrowing this vocabulary word from you, <a href="http://anaherareads.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Ana</a>!) WILL IT CONTINUE FOR FIVE MORE BOOKS + 2 SPIN-OFFS???? The choice is yours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, we&#8217;ve got <strong>$10 to The Book Depository</strong> as a prize for our favorite answer! So go grab your #2 pencil! Bonus points for creativity! Psst&#8230; if you need some fresh ideas for love triangle resolutions, check out <a href="http://abookishheart.com/bookish-thoughts/if-love-triangles-must-exist/" target="_blank">this post over at A Bookish Heart</a> :)</p>

<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-5a4dc603-1989-edb4-8ce1-47f1c6dcfe34"><em><strong>The Reluctant Heroine (Corner A)</strong></em> &#8211; Orphaned as a young child, she recently discovered she has supernatural powers which make her a danger to others since she hasnât learned how to control them. Naturally, she&#8217;s breathtakingly beautiful but also terribly prone to awkwardness and faceplanting.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>The Average Joe (Corner B)</strong></em> &#8211; Has absolutely no powers but has loved her forever. She doesnât want to hurt him and isnât sure if they can have any kind of future together because of who/what she is. But HE&#8217;S SO HOT. HELP.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><strong>The Supernatural Stranger (Corner C)</strong></em> &#8211; He has powers too which means he understands what sheâs going through and can guide her as she figures everything out. But he also has a mysterious connection to what happened to her parents&#8230; AND HE&#8217;S SO HOT. HELP.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">That&#8217;s it! Make us laugh! Make us cry! Make us headdesk into oblivion!</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">And thank you again for making LT101 such a successful event!</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">~ Paola &amp; Alix</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to <strong>Love Triangles 101</strong> &#8212; a geometry lesson on perhaps one of the most polarizing topics in YA these days. What is it about the love triangle that inspires such a wide range of reactions? Why do some love triangles work, while others leave us headdesking ourselves into oblivion? Through the many awesome posts going live during this event, we hope to examine our feelings about love triangles and their intricacies. Questions will be asked, answers will be provided, opinions will be aired, and new perspectives will be presented. I honestly can&#8217;t wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alix and I are <em>beyond</em> thrilled at the response we got about this event. We actually had to extend it by a full week to accommodate the number of fantastic bloggers out there who answered our call, which means you get practically a full month ofÂ  incredible posts to read! We&#8217;d really like to take a moment to thank those bloggers again for their support of Love Triangles 101, and for the awesome topics they came up with&#8230; you guys are the best. EVER.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We hope to announce dates and times for LT101 Twitter chats taking place this month; still trying to sort out all the various timezones in an effort to include as many of you guys as possible in the discussion! We&#8217;ll keep you updated here and on Twitter!</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">To kick off the event, I&#8217;d like to get that discussion going with a question for all of you:</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Which love triangle in YA do you have the strongest feelings for? (Love, hate, indifference, confusion &#8212; whatever your strong feeling is, we want to hear about it!)</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Answering this question in the comments also happens to be one way to win our special LT101 prize: <strong>a $20 giftcard to The Book Depository</strong>! Hey, you could pick something that&#8217;s Certified Love Triangle Free&#8230;! As always, please read the rules before entering; bloggers participating in LT101 are more than welcome to enter as well, and please link the giveaway to your readers if you want! We&#8217;re all about sharing the love~</p>

We both agree that her books truly capture the magic and possibility of summer, but also the hope that the season brings with it &#8212; hope for change, for growth, for good luck and new love. The days are getting longer, the nights seem to last forever, and it&#8217;s a time for both hello and goodbye. Whether you&#8217;re planning vacations or stuck in the office for the next few months, we wish you all the warmth of a Sarah Dessen summer :)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola:</strong> I think most of our regular readers know that I don&#8217;t usually read contemporary. I confess that this is actually my first ever Sarah Dessen summer; I read my first book by this author just last month! I&#8217;m being completely honest when I say that it was one of the most unexpected experiences of my reading life. I&#8217;ve since embarked on a quest to get my hands on every book she&#8217;s ever written, if that&#8217;s any indication of how much I love her work. She always leaves me with characters who feel like my best friends and so much to think about long after I&#8217;ve turned the last page.Â <strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Alix:</strong> I really enjoy Sarah Dessen. I think she is one of the best contemporary YA authors currently publishing. What I&#8217;ve enjoyed the most of about her is how she is able to capture real life, in a non-mundane and clichÃ©d way. She can take the simplest storyline and premise and make it interesting. Her stories and characters ring true. The drama or issues her characters deal with are things we have all gone through or are able to relate to: they aren&#8217;t over the top without being boring and predictable. Whether you&#8217;re already a contemporary YA or wanting to try it out, I highly recommend you pick up a Dessen book!</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">We&#8217;re reviewing a Sarah Dessen book every day this week, with a giveaway on Friday!</h3>

<p>Err, so apparently I live under a rock because I only heard of <a href="http://boutofbooks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Bout of Books</a> very recently (as in, um, 8 hours ago) and therefore didn&#8217;t sign us up for it until approximately&#8230; right now. But that doesn&#8217;t matter, because now we&#8217;re in and ready to join the madness! Here&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bout of Books read-a-thon is organized by Amanda @ On a Book Bender and Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal. It is a week long read-a-thon that begins 12:01am Monday, May 13th and runs through Sunday, May 19th in whatever time zone you are in. Bout of Books is low-pressure, and the only reading competition is between you and your usual number of books read in a week. There are challenges, giveaways, and a grand prize, but all of these are completely optional. For all Bout of Books 7.0 information and updates, be sure to visit the Bout of Books blog. &#8211; From the Bout of Books team</p></blockquote>
<p>Looking forward to being part of the read-a-thon and hanging out with some awesome people! Are you participating this year? If so, we&#8217;ll be sure to say hi if we see you around!</p>
