<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>
