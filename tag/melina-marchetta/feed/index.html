I&#8217;m also really lucky to be good friends with some lovely bloggers who have become my support system, critique group, reading buddies, and fellow cake enthusiasts over the past few months. We&#8217;re the duchesses, and we&#8217;re talking about the third and final installment of the <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10165761-quintana-of-charyn?ac=1" target="_blank"><strong>Quintana of Charyn by Melina Marchetta</strong></a>!

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Melina Marchetta</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">WARNING: SPOILERS ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Only continue reading if you&#8217;ve already finished the book, please! #WhatNeedsToBeDone</strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Spoiler-Free Option</strong></span>: scroll all the way down to the bottom of this post for our feelings translated into GIFS. You&#8217;re welcome.)</h3>
<p><span id="more-4014"></span></p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which characters have you gotten the most attached to over the course of the series, and why?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Oh easy, EVERYONE. Â Well. Â If I canât say thatâ¦ I should say Beatriss and Trevanion because I love their story and they are wonderful characters, but honestly over the course of the whole series, the character that makes me the happiest because he changed so much is Froi. Â To have him start with nothing, to be so reviled in the beginning and just look at him in the end. Â Itâs the biggest character arc, and the fact that heâs conflicted over which country he belongs to, and how he honors the three women who mean the most to him is so touching. Â And that darkness in him thatâs just hovering &#8211; itâs interesting how he overcomes it step by step.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Lucien and Phaedra, they really started to grow on me when I was reading Froi of the Exiles and just seeing them together. Then in Quintana of Charyn they just utterly destroyed me, we only catch glimpses of Lucien and Phaedra which just makes me love them even more because the less Marchetta gives me of Lucien and Phaedra, the more I crave! But I also really loved Froi and Quintana, their relationship is unique and both are quite peculiar by themselves but they fit so well together like two puzzle pieces made for each other.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is Isaboe for me, hands down. I just love her. I love her even when sheâs not at her most loveable. Of course, Iâve felt this way about her since the first book, so no one should be surprised at my answer! Truthfully, I have a soft spot for just about everybody in this series. The most surprising thing for me was how much I ended up loving Froiâ¦ since all my attention was devoted to Finnikin and Evanjalin in the first book, he completely came out of nowhere for me in the second book; I didnât realize how much I would come to love him as a character and how complex he would end up being.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Lucian. He was just a Mont boy whose father died too abruptly that he had to grow up too fast, too soon and in such difficult conditions. Everyone was expecting him to be great and he was just under such tremendous stress. He was trying so hard to follow his head but his heart wouldnât and it was such a frustrating mess of emotions in him. He tried so damn hard to hide his feelings too that I canât help but gravitate towards both empathizing and sympathizing him. At one point, I just wanted everyone to GET OFF HIS BACK ALREADY, CANâT YOU SEE HEâS TRYING. Yup, too invested right there.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Did you have any predictions regarding events in the last book? Did any of those predictions come true?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I predicted it would be a happy ending in an emotionally satisfying way. Â I would absolutely never pick up these books again if the ending let me down and I didnât get a happy resolution!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: It was going to be a total emotional rollercoaster thatâs for sure and IT WAS. Just all my feels pouring out of me like pouring water out, at the end I was in a complete book hangover.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Yes, I predicted I would weep like a complete moron and I did. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: I read blind most of the time so I have barely any predictions. I did not expect an ending with such highly charged emotions though, I was being led falsely into believing it would be a heart-wrenching tragic ending. (Yes, me and my angst. Weeps.)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">How did you feel about the ending??</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: That epilogue man!! It was snapshot after snapshot of the most gorgeously emotional scenes! Â Of love and happiness and hope and joy. Â I mean, it was just perfection!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: WHY DOES IT HAVE TO END?? I mean it was so satisfying but I WANT MORE.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: It was so, so, SO satisfying &#8212; I can recall few other books that have left me feeling so overwhelmingly content. I was laughing and crying for a thousand different reasons. I prefer to have closure when I finish a book and this definitely delivered on that. My only regret concerning this ending was the fact that it had to end at all. I just want it to keep going, on and on. Maybe Melina could tweet me random updates on the charactersâ lives?? âWell guys, Jasmina stole the mail again!â âGuess what? Little Tariq started walking today!!â et al etc. LOL.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Extremely satisfied. Hell, I think I was already satisfied when I read about Luci-en and Phaedra. (Is this too spoilery? Ahâ¦)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">DID YOU CRY???</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: I cried throughout &#8211; little unexpected tearing up at all the moments when it looked like things might go wrong and suddenly went right.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: I wanted to but the tears wouldnât come out lol. It was mainly all internal crying.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: NOT ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IN DEPTH CAUSE ITâS EMBARRASSING</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Iâ¦ didnât. I was more of YES EVERYONE LETâS CELEBRATE!!! THIS CALLS FOR THE MOST GRAND FEAST IN ALL OF CHARYN AND LUMATERE! (Polar opposites from Paola, lmao. STILL!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">What events in the book gave you the ultimate punch of feels?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion (Thatâs a popular one!) Isaboe losing her child and how Finnikin supported her through that. Â And later how the Monts tried to be happy when Isaboe came to visit so she can have their joy. Â Froi and Quintanaâs reunion for just a moment before they took her away. Â And also when Finnikin and Lord August want to adopt Froi so he can have a title. Â Oh and all the scenes in Chapters 1-49 with Epilogue.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Finnikin and Froi reunion!!! Super tense and I was screaming from all the feels. Also that scene with Lucien and Phaedra (youâll probably know what Iâm talking about when you read it), THAT ONE LINE DESTROYED ME. Also the events at Charyn towards the end, I never saw it coming but it made me so happy!!!</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: Omgâ¦ what DIDNâT result in a feels facepunch here??? I think the top three moments that just completely did me in were: 1) when Froi thought he was going to die for sure and Finnikin appeared for the BEST BRO MOMENT EVER IN HISTORY; 2) when Froi and Quintana were reunited and I just kjahfkjhfkshdf DIED; 3) at the end when Finn, Froi and Lucian brought the story back full circle by vowing to be BFFs for life. Runner up: when Quintana opened the gift from Isaboe and it was that same ruby ring.</p>
<p dir="ltr">â¦ Okay, writing all that down just made my heart start aching all over again &gt;&lt;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Beatriss and Trevanionâs âNeed To Talkâ moment. Also, Perri and Tesadoraâs moment of breaking down as they talk about their past losses. Vestieâs meeting âKintanaâ. Lucian and Phaedraâs heated moment(s) of truth tops everything for me, complete with ~swiving~ and everything. There are so many but these are only some off the top of my head. :â)</p>
<h2 dir="ltr" style="text-align: center;">Which character(s) do you think went through the most growth in the series?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well Froi for me with how much he has gained from having friends and family and a purpose. Â And also Quintana &#8211; I was really touched by how much she cared for the girls who took care of her in her pregnancy when it seemed like they all could barely stand each other. Â It makes me hopeful about the people I canât stand in my life. LOL Â But seriously, Quintana is such a prickly character that seeing her opening up and having compassion just makes me want to cry for some reason.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Hmmm I want to say Froi but I think he did most of the growing back in the previous book. I think each and every character had a bit of growth here and there, there wasnât anyone in particular that grew the the most because most of the development happened in the previous two books. But if I really have to choose one I would say Phaedra, sheâs gone through a lot of change and really has grown quite a bit even in this book.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Paola</strong>: This is a tie between Froi and Lucian for me. Froi just made these huge leaps and bounds in character development and all of it slapped me in the face in Book 2. How was this the same Froi??? And then Lucian! I thought he was going to be a minor character based on his minimal involvement with the first book but HOLY MOLY. From having to take over as leader of the Monts when his father died to the heart-crushing Lucian/Phaedra feels, he became so much more than I ever imagined.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Tory</strong>: Who the hell didnât grow in this series, sob. May I say Lucian again? For all the reasons heâs my favourite character in the first place. *weeps tears of rainbow*</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3700" alt="BANNER_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BANNER_lumatere.png" width="516" height="138" /></a>Hi everyone! So it&#8217;s already time for the Week 2 discussion in our <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> read-along! If you missed last week&#8217;s discussion, it&#8217;s definitely not too late to answer &#8212; just stop by Charlene&#8217;s blog for the topic and link up your post. By this time some of you may have already finished the book, but even if you&#8217;re still early in your reading, you should still be able to weigh in on this week&#8217;s topic:</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">The idea of &#8216;home&#8217; is extremely important to the story of Finnikin and Evanjalin&#8217;s journey. How do their ideas of &#8216;home&#8217; differ? What does &#8216;home&#8217; mean to you?</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As someone who has moved around constantly her entire life, my idea of home is kind of a portable concept for me. I&#8217;ve never lived in one place for longer than five years because I grew up as part of a military family, and then I married into the Air Force. So for me, home isn&#8217;t really tied to a specific address. For Finnikin, years of exile have significantly altered what home means; he&#8217;s begun to feel like they need to make their home wherever it&#8217;s possible, and that home doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to mean Lumatere itself. Meanwhile, Evanjalin is fiercely dedicated to returning to their cursed homeland and reclaiming it. For her, home is not something that can be uprooted and moved elsewhere. Home is always going to be Lumatere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But which of these differing solutions is the best one for the exiled Lumateran people? This is one of the foremost conflicts of the book. What are your thoughts? Would you side with Finnikin and try to make a new home for your people, or would you fight to take back the home that is rightfully yours? (Personally I would side with Evanjalin partly because I&#8217;m afraid of NOT siding with her&#8230; hahahaha)</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Unlike my experience actually reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> for the first time, the story behind how I discovered the book isn&#8217;t at all exciting. I devour fantasy books on a regular basis and I&#8217;m always looking for my next escape, which is what led me to Lumatere. I remember skimming through a few reviews on Goodreads and finding myself compelled by the sheer amount of people who were rendered incoherent and/or speechless by this book. This got me thinking that I should probably pick it up.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><img class="alignleft" alt="finnpost01" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/finnpost01-300x151.png" width="300" height="151" /></strong>Some 400 pages later, I realized this had been one of the best literary moments of my life. EVER. But I&#8217;d packed my bags and applied for permanent citizenship long before that. Maybe it was the first time Evanjalin rolled her eyes at Finnikin. (And all the subsequent times hahaha) Maybe it was every single time these characters kept going, never giving up on the home they&#8217;d been forced to leave behind. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on when it happened exactly, but somewhere on that journey I decided I belonged there too.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3909"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think many of us who read fantasy are drawn to the genre because A) it gives us a chance to get away to an entirely different world and/or B) it gives us a chance to live in a world where the epic and the legendary are still possible. Lumatere exemplifies both, for me. This is a place where there is power in every promise, where honor and loyalty still matter, where love is unbreakable. These are people who do absolutely nothing by halves, whether it&#8217;s living or loving or dying. It&#8217;s where friendship is a bond that lasts forever, where I&#8217;ve witnessed every possible way to be brave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It never ceases to amaze. Melina Marchetta is capable of rendering me into a sobbing, laughing, inarticulate mess with only one sentence. This universe of hers even seems to be rendered in colors more vivid than the ones in our spectrum, to the point that reading this series somehow made me feel more <em>alive</em>. And I guess this feeling just makes me want to take this book and give it to everyone I meet. I just want you to see what I see. I want you to experience this crazy, crushing, heartbreaking, exhilarating, BEAUTIFUL feeling. It&#8217;s why I came to Lumatere and never left.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Today&#8217;s the day! We&#8217;re journeying home to Lumatere over the next three weeks, celebrating this incredible series with a read-along of the first book (<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>) and tons of posts from ourselves and fellow bloggers. We&#8217;re so excited!!! Participants: please help us out by tagging your event-related tweets with <strong>#TheJourneyHome</strong> OR mentioning one of us so that we can help promote your posts!</h3>
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-1a2e8067-91c5-22ef-93e4-ab209b42fbe8" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â So fellow Duchess of Lumatere! Â Iâm so happy that itâs time to celebrate these books that we love and I think really brought us together and <strong>I thought a good first question is how did you come to read Finnikin of the Rock in the first place?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Good question, fellow Duchess of Lumatere! I saw tons of wonderful reviews for the books ranging from outright incoherency to just buckets full of tears and decided that this book needed to be read. So I read it. And it was life changing!!!! I wonât ask you how you decided to read the book cause I am the person who made you read itâ¦ hahahaha.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL! And Iâm forever grateful! I saved it to read on a flight to London, and it was great to pass the tedious time at the airport. Â Since this book is rather life changing for people who fall in love with the story &#8211; <strong>what would you say makes this book stand apart from other YA fantasies out there?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â I think the biggest difference between this book (well, entire series) and other fantasies is that it packs so much emotion into every scene. There are no emotions done by halves. Everything that happens between these characters is seriously so visceral and unforgettable, you just get punched in the face repeatedly by the Feels. Iâm not saying other books arenât also capable of eliciting strong emotionsâ¦ Iâm just saying that Melina Marchetta should receive multiple awards for being able to make me burst into tears with only one freaking sentence!!! <strong>What do YOU think makes this book special??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3871"></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well I totally agree with that! Â Iâm always amazed by how well Melina Marchetta builds all of her stories with realistic, involved characters who have such emotional complexity so that just one sentence, like you said, is enough to knock you over. Â Because thereâs so much depth and meaning to the characters and to the words. Â Iâm also amazed at how Melina can turn around characters. Â I think itâs the thing I remarked upon the most in my review of Finnikin &#8211; two characters that I wasnât so sure about in the beginning and just grew to completely love by the end. Â Itâs solid writing!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I have another quick question actually about the first time you read this book &#8211; <strong>did it take you some time to become enthralled by it? Â And I know Evanjalin is your absolute favorite character &#8211; did it take time for you to warm up to her?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Hmm. Yes, I think it did take a few chapters before I started to really find myself unable to put it down. It was never a bad experience, though, more like it started off a bit slow and I had to learn a lot of characters and history, but it was when Finn and Evanjalin met for the first time that I began to formally sit up and Pay Attention. And noâ¦ I didnât take ANY time to warm up to her. I loved her from the start. Something in her nature speaks to me, and something about her devotion to her cause just made me want to follow her to the ends of the earth. She embodies the phrase âWhat needs to be done.â Which, for those of you who havenât read the book yet, you will understand eventuallyâ¦. <strong>Did you take time to warm up to her?</strong> I know she isnât an easy character to love and is prone to being misunderstood. But I think that many people with strong personalities come off this way.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â I think the beginning was the same for me &#8211; thereâs some past history you need to catch up on, so once you settle into the story, it moves pretty quickly. Â As for Evanjalin, sheâs definitely admirable, and her backstory is full of tragedy so I think I excused some of the harshness in her character. Â There was one moment though (which I canât talk about now) when I was pretty upset with her and I wasnât even sure if she was the good gal or the bad gal in the story. Â But I know it was part of how Melina wanted to tell the story &#8211; with Evanjalin, she needed to be a little misunderstood like you say.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>So hereâs a question that I have difficulty answering but Iâm wondering if you have any thoughts on it &#8211; the book is called Finnikin of the Rock, but I felt like Finn and Evanjalin had an almost equal share of importance in this book. Â So why is Finn made the title character do you think?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â As a sympathy/consolation prize because Evanjalin obviously wears the pants here??? JUST KIDDING. LOLOLOL. Hmm, honestly I think the first book ended up being named after Finn because it is the story of his destinyâ¦ and how he came to accept that destiny, even if it wasnât what he envisioned at all for his life. Theyâre both very strong personalities. And while Finn never really envisions himself as The Hero, he never thought he would be Co-Hero either. Itâs about Finnâs journey home and itâs about his process of growing up. So I think itâs right that he got the title for himself; he plays a huge role, even if Evanjalin laughs at him for crying cause he got shot with a few arrows. â BAHAHAHAHA I LAUGHED TOO SORRY FINN</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I personally believe that Finnikin and Evanjalin are a total power couple in every sense of the word, but they arenât the only couple in the story. I think this is when you should talk about who else made their way into your heart over the course of the story! *pokes you*</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â Well first GOOD ANSWER!! *claps and cheers Family Feud style* This chat is really so I can get you to think about this story for me, btw. <em>(<strong>Paola</strong>: CRAFTY MINX)</em> LOL Â I look forward to keeping the idea that this is Finnâs journey in mind as I re-read the book!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">And as you mentioned, there is a certain couple that played on my heartstrings (and another great part of this whole series is how many different romances come into play! Â Thereâs a couple for everybody!) Â The love between Beatriss and Trevanion &#8211; which was gradually revealed if I remember correctly -thereâs all these little details to how they met and fell in love that come together to paint the picture of their difficult relationship &#8211; is full of face-punching Feels moments! Â Iâm definitely going to go into this more in my topic post about this couple, but I do want to say that if you like your true love romances broken by nearly-insurmountable odds where the beloveds have to find their way back to each other, then send your Thank You cards to Melina Marchetta right now!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Charlene is completely right &#8212; this is a series for the romantics out there. But donât be fooled into thinking that this means itâs all fluff and rainbows, cause it totally isnât. NOT AT ALL. *points to where Charlene mentioned ânearly-insurmountable oddsâ and cackles viciously* Okay, I can cackle viciously because Iâve already read all three books and know all of the glory and majesty firsthand. But! <strong>Charlene, do you have any advice for all our read-along followers who will be diving in for the first time??</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â LOL, well not to put any of our new readers off, but Paola and I will be cackling maniacally throughout this read-along as we see how much you all are suffering. :) Â But seriously, I think everyone will thank us in the end. Â *hopes* Â I suppose for some advice, Iâd say the maps are really helpful. Â I read this on my kindle the first time, so flipping back to the map on it wasnât very fun, but if you really take in all the places it will help you follow along with all the history and the events. Â Also if you read this all in one go &#8211; before the end of the 2 weeks &#8211; feel free to message, tweet, email Paola and I if you want to vent, cry, or swoon! We are here for you! Â <strong>Do you have any advice Paola?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Paola</strong>: Â Yes, be sure to stock up on tissues and have lots of room to flail around weeping and sobbing like an idiot. Then prepare to be catatonic for at least an hour after turning the final page. Hahahahaha but seriously my hope is that everyone who does this read-along with us discovers a new series to love. Iâm not sure that any of you can match my obsessive, fanatical Lumatere love, but thatâs okay. I forgive you for that.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Charlene</strong>: Â You guys, seriously. Â I LOVE these books, and I donât think *I* even match Paolaâs Lumateran obsession! Â Sheâs Finnikin Ambassador for a reason! Â I donât know how many people out there have not read this book, but Iâm sure sheâll get at least half of that percentage converted in her lifetime. LOL</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">I think itâs time now to let all you readers go and enjoy Lumatere! Â Have a great time! Â Keep in touch! Â Feel free to post your own discussions on your blog &#8211; weâll have a Linky every Friday so you can link up, or visit either Paola or my blog on Fridays to talk! Â <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Oh, and thank you so much for joining us for this event!</strong></span></p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">A Special Bulletin From Your Finnikin Ambassador</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As most of you are well aware, I have made it my mission in life to <del>harass</del> convince everyone in the universe to read an incredible high fantasy series called <em>The Lumatere Chronicles </em>(<a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a>, <a title="Froi of the Exiles" href="http://novelideareviews.com/froi-of-the-exiles/"><em>Froi of the Exiles</em></a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15754483-quintana-of-charyn" target="_blank"><em>Quintana of Charyn</em></a>), by Melina Marchetta. I can&#8217;t even begin to express to you how much I love these books &#8212; they leave me an inarticulate, sobbing, comatose mess. After finally reading <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> earlier this year (WHERE HAD IT BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!) I subsequently spread the Finnikin fever to several friends, happy customers all, and now we gush about the series frequently. One of those friends is the lovely <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Charlene</a> over at <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>, and we&#8217;ve teamed up to put together an entire event dedicated to our shared obsession. You can get more details from <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html" target="_blank">our intro post at Charlene&#8217;s blog</a>, but basically we&#8217;ll be hosting a read-along of the first book as well as three weeks of posts from all over the book blogging world on <em>The Lumatere Chronicles</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3695"></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.sg/2013/09/the-journey-home-introduction-and-sign.html"><img class="wp-image-3617 alignleft" alt="BADGE_lumatere" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/BADGE_lumatere.png" width="219" height="220" /></a>Tentative Scheduling:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Event runs from October 7th &#8211; 27th</strong><br />
<strong><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> Read-Along:</strong> October 7th-20th. (Thatâs two weeks to read 400pg)<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether you&#8217;re new to the series or love it as much as we do, we&#8217;d love it if you joined us on our journey home to Lumatere!

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Melina Marchetta</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 400 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The throne of Lumatere has been restored, the dark curse lifted at long last. Three years after liberating their kingdom, the people of Lumatere are still in the process of healing. Froi, once a slave and now one of the King and Queen&#8217;s most beloved friends, has come to see this land as home. But blood sings to blood, as he discovers when he is sent into Charyn on a mission that will endanger his life and make him question where &#8216;home&#8217; truly lies&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So since I&#8217;ve become semi-famous in our little corner of the book blogging universe as the official <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/"><em>Finnikin</em> </a>Ambassador, you should not be surprised by my enthusiasm for the second book in the series. GUYS. <em>So much love</em> for this world and the people in it. I can&#8217;t even articulate it properly. Every time anything related to the <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em> is mentioned I seriously just fall apart into a mess of lovestruck babbling. (Also, every time I see someone I know adding these books to their TBR pile it makes me feel all kittens-and-rainbows for at least the next 24 hours.) Anyway, I must warn you that it was really pretty impossible to write this review without including massive spoilers for Book I, so please run away NOW if you haven&#8217;t read Finnikin of the Rock yet!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2119"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Getting this out of the way now: the reason why I took off half a star was because this book kind of dragged for me in places. I think the first had better pacing. There were moments that did feel rather repetitive and drawn out. But I can&#8217;t really complain, because there is still so much power and emotion that it tides you over throughout. It never felt like an in-between book, although I am definitely terrified to start Book III now because I DON&#8217;T THINK I CAN SURVIVE IT. And I don&#8217;t think I can say goodbye!!!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This second book has a slightly different feel to it than the first. It isn&#8217;t a negative change at all, just a very palpable difference between the two installments. As you might have surmised from the title, Book II shifts its focus to Froi and his journey beyond the borders of Lumatere into the neighboring kingdom of Charyn &#8212; the land responsible for the terrible crimes committed against Lumatere in the first book. Now, Froi is not Finnikin. He&#8217;s an entirely different creature, as fierce in his hatreds as he is in his loyalties, and there is a savagery in him that Finnikin doesn&#8217;t have. I honestly was so engrossed in Finnikin and Evanjalin during the first book that I hardly considered Froi, although I did get the sense that he would play a much larger role in the future. I&#8217;m glad I was given this chance to get to know his character better, because I ended up loving him as much as I love Finn. (But not as much as I love Isaboe. Because Isaboe is my spirit animal.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Froi carries the story effortlessly. I loved his ferocity. I loved his unexpected patience and deep-seated affection for Quintana, in all her many moods and eccentricities, and despite the fact that she isn&#8217;t the easiest person to care for. I loved that the things Froi loved most in Quintana were a wild heart and unpredictable mind. But most of all, I was rendered a complete mess by the intensity with which Froi <em>believed</em> in Quintana &#8212; in all the things she could be, rather than what she might never be. <strong><em>&#8220;Imagine who she would be if we unleashed her onto the world. I think she would rip the breath from all of us.&#8221;</em></strong> Okay, try to sit there with a straight face and tell me you wouldn&#8217;t fall helplessly in love with someone who held so much hopeÂ and unwavering belief in his heart for you. Froi never focused on Quintana&#8217;s fragility, but on her strengths. He doesn&#8217;t try to change her, loving her instead for the person she is. Their relationship involves complications that aren&#8217;t present in the dynamic between Finn and Isaboe, but I came to love this pair so much more than I initially thought I would.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of Finn and Isaboe, can I just mention how much I appreciated being able to see them again?? So often in a series we spend the entire time waiting with bated breath for the happy ending, not reaching it until the last book. In this case, we&#8217;re able to see what happens after the happy ending, the joys as well as the sorrows. I loved that Marchetta didn&#8217;t skirt around the issues between Finn and Isaboe, issues that weren&#8217;t just magically laid to rest when the first book ended. I loved that Isaboe, a character I love with an intensity you can&#8217;t even imagine, was portrayed in all her greatness but also in her weakness. I think we didn&#8217;t see enough of this side to her in the first book and it really rounded out her character for me, making her more believable. As well, we&#8217;re able to see these two continually working on maintaining a balance between Isaboe&#8217;s position of power and Finnikin&#8217;s underlying insecurities because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I knew this book was going to facepunch me with the feels, but the thing is that I never expected it to come from Lucian&#8217;s corner. Just&#8230; wow. I really liked him in the first book and was so excited to see him take a larger role in this one, but I had NO IDEA he and Phaedra would leave me squeaking incoherently and flailing around like a moron. HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO HANDLE THIS?? I barely made it through Finn and Evanjalin and all THEIR feels, which btw are still on-going. Now I&#8217;ve also got Froi and Quintana PLUS Lucian and Phaedra and I JUST. I CAN&#8217;T. How is it possible to love fictional people this much???</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s hard to believe Melina Marchetta&#8217;s earlier novels are all contemporary. I would never have guessed this based on how masterfully she writes fantasy &#8212; from the depth and scope of her world to the relationships between her characters and the raw emotion she can invoke through them. I am so invested in this series at this point that I have no idea what I&#8217;ll do when I finally bring myself to read the last book. How will I move on?? It&#8217;s so rare for a series to move me as deeply as this one has so far. As the official Finnikin Ambassador, I hope you&#8217;ll consider reading the books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; And by that I mean I hope you go get them RIGHT NOW.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So first of all, <em><strong>thank you</strong></em> to everyone who entered the giveaway! It was the first giveaway ever to be hosted here and the response was so much more than I was expecting. I was determined to send some of my favorite fantasy books home with people who would love them, and I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that <em><strong>Charlotte</strong></em> (<a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Gypsy Reviews</a>) and Ana (<a href="http://anaherareads.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Anahera Reads</a>) are the lucky winners! Charlotte chose <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/" target="_blank"><em>Stormdancer</em></a> by Jay Kristoff and Ana&#8217;s pick was <a title="Finnikin of the Rock" href="http://novelideareviews.com/finnikin-of-the-rock/" target="_blank"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></a> by Melina Marchetta. YOU GUYS HAVE SUCH GOOD TASTE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/winners.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1886" alt="winners" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/winners.png" width="335" height="249" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were two ways to win the giveaway: randomly via Rafflecopter/the whims of the universe and by leaving the most badass comment ever on the face of the planet. Charlotte was our random winner, while Ana was The Chosen One in the commenting competition. (Completely coincidentally, she is also being interviewed here on for the <a href="http://wp.me/p3wUOd-ug" target="_blank">Reading Overseas</a> feature today! Have you checked it out yet??) Both of these lovely ladies have been informed of their winnings through extremely exuberant tweets, but guys, I had to write this announcement post anyway because I want to thank EVERYBODY for your entries &#8212; for following us on <a href="http://twitter.com/_anovelidea" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, for adding us on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/novelideareviews" target="_blank">Facebook</a>, for all the promo tweets and comments and just participating in the giveaway in the first place. You&#8217;re so awesome!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And also, you really need to read Ana&#8217;s comment, because it&#8217;s brilliant. Here it is:</p>
<div>
<blockquote><p>Allow us to set the scene for Ana deciding which book she would choose if she wonâ¦ It is a stormy night, travelers seeking shelter in any seedy crowded pub they find. In The Ailing Wombat, the mugs of ale overflow, cards litter every table as money and livestock is gambled away in a momentâs inebriation. Somewhere, two men are arguing about their mothers and are about to start a bar fight.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this chaos, there is a quiet spot in the corner. At the corner table sits a girl wearing a cloak and hood with an air of âI am not supposed to be here. You do not notice me.â and invoking just about every fantasy trope involving a stranger in a bar. Except maybe the animal familiar.</p>
<p>She is asked what she is seeking. At this question, the corners of her lips twitch upward and she takes a long sip of her drink, coughing a bit thanks to the alcohol and ruining her non-existent mystique. She is seeking for the book called Finnikin of the Rock. She has heard tales of this young man and his mysterious companion. She wishes to read about them in the comfort of her own home, to be lost in the fantastical world of the tome, and because she actually canât go on her epic quest.</p>
<p>The asker of the question leaves. It is not always the best idea to interview strangers at bars. Especially one that is currently reading off her list of âFantasy Tropes to Invoke in This Comment.â</p>
<p>END SCENE</p></blockquote>
<p>Now if that isn&#8217;t worth a copy of <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em>, I don&#8217;t know what is. Congratulations again, ladies!!</p>
<p>Before I go, <a title="Maid of Secrets (+ ARC Giveaway!)" href="http://novelideareviews.com/maid-of-secrets-arc-giveaway/">did you know we&#8217;re giving away our ARC of <em>Maid of Secrets</em>??</a></p>

<p><strong>TITLE</strong>: <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em></p>
<p><strong>SERIES</strong>: <em>Lumatere Chronicles</em>, #1</p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Melina Marchetta</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 417 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten years ago, tragedy and betrayal destroyed the kingdom of Lumatere. The royal family was ruthlessly murdered, an impostor took the throne, and a terrible curse brought darkness in its wake. Finnikin, now numbering among the thousands of the displaced and the exiled, has spent those ten years traveling the country in search of a second homeland for his people. It all seems hopeless, until word reaches Finnikin and his guardian of a girl who can lead them to an unexpected salvation: a surviving heir to the throne, one who could lead them back to Lumatere at last. Countless dangers, lies, and secrets stand between them and their beloved home, but the only way is forward, and neither Finnikin nor Evanjalin would ever consider turning back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, I still can&#8217;t be coherent over this book. It&#8217;s so pathetic. I already spent the entire experience reading it either A) running around the house cheering or B) running around the house weeping because it was JUST. THAT. GOOD. It reminded me of all the things I love about High Fantasy, because it contains all of them and then some. The characters are compelling, the story is moving&#8230; even the romance (which is not the most prominent feature by a long shot) had me squeaking and carrying on like an idiot. As soon as I turned the last page, I turned BACK and read the last chapter again because I couldn&#8217;t bear to let go. In fact, I am refraining from starting the next book in the series on purpose, knowing that I will get absolutely nothing done if I let myself read it right now. Anyway, keep reading for more of my lovestruck babbling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1471"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&#8217;t be fooled: while this book is called <em>Finnikin of the Rock</em>, Finnikin himself only carries half the story. The other half is in the hands of Evanjalin, a force of nature whose determination, foresight, and resourcefulness are just plain intense. She became an instant favorite of mine. I read a lot of books in this genre, and it saddens me to admit that there is a shortage of fantasy heroines for girls and women to look up to; like video games, it&#8217;s still unfortunately very much the territory of men and male-oriented themes. Even Finnikin has quite a few moments spent being a colossal man-child. I maintain that Evanjalin is the heart of this book, even if it doesn&#8217;t bear her name in the title. Finnikin himself often acknowledges that he&#8217;d be lost without her, and it&#8217;s completely true. This is a girl who&#8217;s come through the fire, who has been forced to endure death, betrayal, and countless dangers to make it to where she is now. She&#8217;s a fighter, and she&#8217;s tough without losing her inherent qualities of kindness and compassion. Most of all, she makes mistakes. She lies, takes risks, drives her companions up the wall with her crackpot schemes. But Evanjalin is willing to do anything to save the land of her birth, and that in itself is heroic to me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, so Evanjalin leads Finnikin around by the nose a lot. This isn&#8217;t disparaging Finnikin, who balances her utterly. Another quality of the book that makes me love it is the relationship between these two, who spend a lot of time at odds with one another and yet are inseparable nonetheless. It&#8217;s a friendship, and an undeniable romance (more of a rivalmance, actually), but most of all a <em>partnership</em>. They would tear throats for each other, go to war for each other, die for each other. It&#8217;s the kind of epic love story that is all the more powerful because it isn&#8217;t the only thing going on. It&#8217;s there, behind the scenes, and when it takes center stage it just results in the most poignant, moving moments of the entire story. They&#8217;re not a perfect pair &#8212; their relationship is frequently challenged, both by outside elements and by their own doubts. But there&#8217;s no stopping them, and there&#8217;s no question that they belong together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hang on, I have to go cry again. Ugh. This book reduces me to a sobbing wreck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ahem. Back to me reviewing this book. The plot itself is a bit linear, mostly following the usual layout of an epic adventure, but Marchetta fills in the tried and true format with living, breathing details. Finnikin and Evanjalin were born in the kingdom of Lumatere, brought down by regicide, betrayal and dark magic a decade ago. Their people are exiles, wandering the continent in search of a home to replace the one they lost. There is suffering, poverty, and bloodshed. One of the main conflicts between Finn and Evanjalin is the question of what their next step should be. Is it better for the Lumaterans to establish a second homeland and finally surrender the one that is rightfully theirs, or should they come together and reclaim their kingdom once and for all? There&#8217;s no easy answer to that question, and no painless way to win. No matter which direction they choose, loss and sacrifice are inevitable. This is the story of their journey home, wherever home will finally be, but it&#8217;s also a journey of self-discovery, and the process of learning what <em>home</em> truly means.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before you decide you want to experience this book, be aware that readers who don&#8217;t usually go for fantasy may be discouraged by the sheer size of Marchetta&#8217;s world and its population of characters. There are a lot of names to remember, places to recall, and an entire history to learn. There is never a massive info dump, but if you&#8217;re daunted by this aspect of the genre, you may have some issues.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Finnikin of the Rock</em> now has a permanent place in my heart. It&#8217;s unforgettable, intense, and moving. It took my heart and crushed it, and yet I just want more. Regular readers of the genre will appreciate its handling of the usual ingredients for epic High Fantasy while still coming through with unique elements. Those who gravitate toward books with compelling characters need look no further. And if you&#8217;re a girl who reads fantasy and has long been disappointed with how terribly boy-centric they are, you need to meet Evanjalin and watch her run circles around Finnikin. It&#8217;s extremely gratifying. (Note: if you don&#8217;t like this book, don&#8217;t tell me. We may have to fight. LOL.)</p>
