<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3.jpg"><img class="alignleft" alt="photo_3" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_3-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a>So for <a title="Recap: Crown of Midnight Launch (Or, EEEEK)" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-crown-of-midnight-launch-or-eeeek/">my first ever author event</a>, I drove 3 hours and 40 minutes to LA for the <em>Crown of Midnight</em> launch party (also lovingly referred to around here as <em>The Explosion of Sarah Maas Fangirl Feels</em> and <em>The Time <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Charlene</a> &amp; I Turned the Entire Event Into a Melina Marchetta Flailing Session</em>) and I had a BLAST. This time, however, I only had to drive 15 minutes to the Barnes &amp; Noble near my house for the first stop on the <a href="http://www.pitchdark.com/blog/dark-days-fall-2013/" target="_blank"><strong>Fall 2013 Dark Days Tour</strong></a>! Which, of course, was an incredible experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see from this lovely poster I picked up at the bookstore, the authors on tour were special guest Tera Lynn Childs (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10429067-sweet-venom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Sweet Venom</em></a>), Madeleine Roux (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597728-asylum?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Asylum</em></a>), Rae Carson (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11431896-the-bitter-kingdom?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The</em> <em>Bitter Kingdom</em></a>), Michelle Gagnon (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>), Mindy McGinnis (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13112869-not-a-drop-to-drink?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>Not A Drop To Drink</em></a>) and Sherry Thomas (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332556-the-burning-sky?from_search=true" target="_blank"><em>The Burning Sky</em></a>). I was mainly there to fangirl incessantly over Sherry Thomas because I&#8217;d just finished reading her book on Tuesday and still hadn&#8217;t fully recovered from the awesome. I think meeting her only caused a relapse and now all I want to do is read it again, actually. You can hear me gush over it in my review <a title="The Burning Sky" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-burning-sky/">over here</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To kick the event off, the authors all took some time to tell the audience about their book. Everyone volunteered Sherry Thomas to go first, so of course she completely proves my theory that we&#8217;re kindred spirits by announcing, &#8220;My book is about cross-dressing.&#8221; Which it is!!! I&#8217;m in the audience like, YES!!! *squeaking with joy*</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3771"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She went on to clarify that <em>The Burning Sky</em> features a girl who dresses as a boy at Eton College in the 1800&#8242;s. She explained that she wanted to write a book that sort of had a Harry Potter vibe, but that of course the whole &#8220;magical school&#8221; thing had already been done, so she decided to go at it from a different angle. While brainstorming, she realized that in the 1800&#8242;s the only prestigious schools were for boys, which set her protagonist Iolanthe on the cross-dressing path. She compared her hero Prince Titus to Morpheus from <em>The Matrix</em> films because he&#8217;s known forever that his task is to prepare The One for her epic quest&#8230; except that in this case, her &#8220;Morpheus&#8221; discovers that &#8220;Neo&#8221; is in fact a girl. At this point I&#8217;m just giggling with glee and clutching my copy of her book to my chest cause I want to hug it forever. LOL.</p>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-3782 alignright" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rae Carson, who just released the final installment of her <em>Girl of Fire &amp; Thorns</em> series, described her books as being full of travel, epic battles, more travel, awesome navel bling, and not your typical &#8220;skinny&#8221; heroine. Mindy McGinnis cracked me up by summing up <em>Not A Drop To Drink</em> as, &#8220;The Hunger Games meets <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>, except wearing pants, and with NO unicorns or rainbows.&#8221; Um, obviously I need to read this. SOLD!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The panel was asked about the research they did for their books, and Michelle Gagnon shared that she actually had a real hacker go through her books to make sure everything was legit. I thought this was rather amazing. Mindy McGinnis revealed that she lives pretty much the way her main character lives; Rae Carson at this point quipped that Mindy, &#8220;shoots people from her roof.&#8221; LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Madeleine Roux, whose book takes place in a renovated asylum, talked about the often disturbing experience of going through tons and tons of photos from asylums over the course of writing. Tera Lynn Childs went to San Francisco for week-long research while writing her books &#8212; Greek mythology fans, her series is about three girls who are descended from the gorgon Medusa &#8212; and used both trips to scout out the place her characters would be living and hunting monsters in.</p>
<div id="attachment_3784" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3784" alt="photo_2" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_2-300x226.jpg" width="300" height="226" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">I ran into Sara, blogger at A Nerd Girl Says, who drove 3 hours to see Rae Carson! The last time I saw her was at the Sarah Maas event, when I was the one who had driven 3 hours! Serendipity, I tell you!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of research while writing, Sherry Thomas advised that you should read and research as much as you can, but include as little of it as possible in your book. Too much research is boring! She talked about her experiences reading firsthand accounts of life at Eton College and said she could&#8217;ve gone on and on about what it&#8217;s like to be a student there BUT she took only as much as she needed to in order to set the scene for her characters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing her streak of fantastic one-liners during this panel, Sherry answered a question about snacks while writing by telling us about Deadline Cake. GUYS. DEADLINE CAKE. When her deadline comes around, she orders a 4-layer, 8-inch cake and slowly devours it over the course of a week or so. &#8220;As a meal, of course.&#8221; I DIED. CAN WE BE BEST FRIENDS FOREVER??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The authors were asked if they had any fangirling experiences over other authors; Michelle Gagnon told us an embarrassing tale about meeting Stephen King and completely creeping him out! Rae Carson talked about sitting at a table across from <em>Gone Girl</em> author Gillian Flynn and trying really hard not to stare at her the entire time in pure admiration. Sherry Thomas confessed that she stalks people silently on their blogs &#8220;for their safety.&#8221; Again, I died. Not only does this woman write a book I love to death, she shares my love for cake AND is a ninja. THE END. I NEED NOTHING MORE IN THIS LIFE.</p>
<div id="attachment_3786" style="width: 236px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-3786" alt="photo_4" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_4-226x300.jpg" width="226" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Me + Sherry Thomas!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the Q&amp;A with the panel, I got my books signed and squeaked my way through a conversation with Sherry Thomas when it was my turn. I asked her how she ended up going from writing romance to YA fantasy, and she replied that actually she was asked if she might want to try writing fantasy and thought it was a good idea. Yes, a very good idea, cause she totally killed it guys.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I *may* have gushed like a complete moron over Prince Titus&#8230; but it&#8217;s okay cause she was like, &#8220;I LOVE HIM TOO!!&#8221; And then I got some fantastic exclusive Prince Titus trivia; apparently after she&#8217;d written the book, Sherry discovered that the name Titus actually means (okay this is not an exact quote because I was incoherent at the time due to fangirl feels), <em>&#8220;the classic Promethean hero villain who will do anything for his cause.&#8221;</em> Which is so ridiculously perfect for this character, you have no idea! I declared that this was fate. She concurred. Then I died of Awesome for the 4th or 5th time in one evening.</p>
<div id="attachment_3789" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_21.jpg"><img class="wp-image-3789 " alt="photo_2" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_21-226x300.jpg" width="203" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Dear Paola, look forward to a beautiful friendship&#8221; UM THIS IS THE SOUND OF MY DREAMS COMING TRUE??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sherry was kind enough to write the sweetest thing ever when she signed my book, AND she signed an extra copy to give away here on the blog! You lucky, lucky people! I decided that my love for <em>The Burning Sky</em> must be spread to every corner of the universe and will be giving away this signed copy PLUS a tin of homemade hand balm that Sherry made herself! I know, she just keeps getting exponentially more amazing the longer I talk about her. Seriously. So if you want to win some swag, you can enter the giveaway at the end of this post!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also got a copy of <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> by Mindy McGinnis! It was hilarious actually because when Mindy opened my book she accidentally tore the corner of the title page! But it was totally okay because now my book has a fun story behind it. I feel like the ripped page adds character. I guess she didn&#8217;t realize her own epic survivalist strength! <a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo_11.jpg" target="_blank">So that&#8217;s why she wrote &#8220;Oops! Sorry!&#8221; in the corner, haha.</a> I haven&#8217;t read the book yet but I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. I have special swag to give away from Mindy as well, actually &#8212; watch for my review of her book in the next few weeks cause I&#8217;ll give them away then!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-3787" alt="photo" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/photo1-300x300.jpg" width="240" height="240" /></a>I also want to point out to you guys that all the authors on the panel had these super fancy &#8220;signed by the author&#8221; stickers! Sherry made them for everyone! (What did I tell you about exponentially increasing levels of amazing??) I snapped photos of them cause I thought they were such a nice touch. Each one had their own logo specific to the author&#8217;s book. There&#8217;s a phoenix on the one for <em>The Burning Sky</em> and a drop of water for <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Okay, ANYWAY I had a great time and just loved getting the chance to meet all these great authors! Especially Sherry Thomas. It&#8217;s so wonderful when you love an author&#8217;s book SO MUCH and then you get to meet them and you can only love them MORE. I can&#8217;t recommend her book more, truly one of my favorite 2013 releases. Want to win a signed copy?? I&#8217;m giving one away! YOU WANT THIS BOOK. TRUST ME. Because of hundreds of reasons that I am not going to elaborate on or I&#8217;ll be here rambling forever. So here&#8217;s your chance to find out for yourself!</p>
