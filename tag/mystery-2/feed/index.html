<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jessi Kirby</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Simon &amp; Schuster BFYR; Hardcover, 377 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At seventeen, Parker Frost has always made the right choices. Her future lies along a straight road, one without bends or unexpected crossroads, and she&#8217;s devoted a lot of time to making only the safest decisions. She doesn&#8217;t have regrets&#8230; or so she tells herself. When she stumbles upon the possibility of uncovering what really happened on the night of her town&#8217;s most enduring tragedy, Parker decides to take a leap of faith and tries taking the road less traveled. The ensuing revelations shed light on the fates of two lives ended before their time, but also compel her to reconsider the chances she missed and the chances she can still take.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While it gets off to a bit of a slow start, <em>Golden</em> ended up being impossible to put down. Layered in with all the mystery is a genuine coming of age story, something that I didn&#8217;t expect to connect with as much as I did. As Parker delves into the truth about what happened ten years ago, other truths begin rising to the surface. This book has so much to say about the choices we make, the secrets we keep, and the regrets we live with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3009"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first quarter or so of <em>Golden</em> involves a lot of background on Parker Frost, its protagonist, who is the quintessential &#8216;good girl&#8217; in every sense of the word. She&#8217;s skipped out on a lot of the traditional teenaged shenanigans to focus on school, earning a place at Stanford University when she leaves for college in the fall. She&#8217;s conflicted though, because all the late nights spent studying instead of making memories (stupid or otherwise) are suddenly making her wonder if she made the right choice. How much of life has she missed out on because she was so busy avoiding the chance that she might make mistakes?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;But what I didn&#8217;t realize at the time, what I missed all along, is that chance is everywhere. It&#8217;s also what life is made of. It&#8217;s all around us, but most of the time we never see it working. We turn left instead of right, we take the stairs instead of the elevator, cross the street for no apparent reason. Our lives are made of these little moments that somehow add up, and sometimes, if we look back, we can see chance at work.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I didn&#8217;t expect myself to relate so well to Parker Frost. I mean, if you think about it, I&#8217;m pretty much a full decade older than she is. I graduated high school ages ago, went to college, then graduated from that too. You&#8217;d think our worlds would be pretty far removed from one another, just like I did when I started this book. That&#8217;s where I was wrong. Actually, there&#8217;s a pretty significant part of me that has a lot in common with Parker. She arrives at this point in her life where she realizes that all she&#8217;s ever done is play by the rules &#8212; she gets good grades, she does what her mother tells her to do, doesn&#8217;t take risks that might sabotage the carefully plotted future lying in wait for her. I&#8217;ve never been much of a rule breaker myself; in fact, I&#8217;m a total Rules Person, comforted by the existence of boundaries. As a teacher, and as someone who has known she wanted to be a teacher since she was five years old, I think an affinity for following rules just goes along with the territory. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I haven&#8217;t broken a few here and there, and whether those choices became adventures or misadventures, I&#8217;m glad I colored outside the lines when I did. One of this book&#8217;s many poignant messages is that you don&#8217;t have to end up regretting the chances you didn&#8217;t take.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I credit this book with overcoming its slow beginning with a mystery that I wasn&#8217;t able to set aside. I had to find out what was happening, snatching up every small detail and clue with abject greed. Not only that, I found myself really invested in Parker&#8217;s search for the truth, and for her true self. Once you get past the initial backstory phase, the mystery takes hold and it becomes an undeniable page turner. Even though I kind of knew where it was heading anyway, the real reason why I found it so compelling was that every layer of that mystery peeled away was another layer of Parker that could shine through. I&#8217;d say the coming of age story is enhanced by the mystery, and not the other way around.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing I credit this book with: having one of the most involved, present, and positive examples of a &#8220;best friend&#8221; character that I&#8217;ve seen in a while. Unlike her contemporaries in other YA novels, Parker&#8217;s best friend Kat doesn&#8217;t disappear over the course of the story. She&#8217;s there for Parker, supporting and goading her by turns, and I liked that she never faded into the background. All too often, YA heroines seem to lose track of everything and everyone else in their lives, falling into this state of tunnel vision. Parents go missing, friends fall by the wayside, and suddenly our protagonist has no visible support system. Parker has one, and I appreciated it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Um, also I appreciated Trevor. He is adorable. Trevor, never change. Always be an adorable ski resort boy who understands that ice cream has the power to get a girl through a crisis. Seriously. I MEAN IT.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contemporary reads I like best always end up being the ones that could appeal even to those who don&#8217;t normally read contemporary. I&#8217;m the same way, and I definitely recommend <em>Golden</em> if you&#8217;re not a diehard contemporary fan but like a little bit here and there in between wild flights of fancy, haha. (Also if you&#8217;re a poetry nerd, as I ended up being after the year I spent taking AP Lit in high school and doing nothing but parsing through poems during my senior year. There&#8217;s a whole lot of Robert Frost and Mary Oliver going on here. I loved it!) As with most books I&#8217;ve read in this genre, though, I had to take off a star for the mild predictability of the plot in some places. I also had an issue with Julianna&#8217;s journal entries and some of the dialogue in general, which seemed unrealistic for characters who were ostensibly teenagers. That wasn&#8217;t enough to make me dislike the book &#8212; actually if you can&#8217;t tell, I loved the book, so don&#8217;t let it deter you. Ah, and it&#8217;s also one of the books I decided to give away as part of <a title="Itâs Our 5th Birthday! Redesign + Giveaway" href="http://novelideareviews.com/its-our-5th-birthday-redesign-giveaway/">our 5th Birthday</a>!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Teri Brown</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical Fiction/Paranormal</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Balzer + Bray; Hardcover, 373 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anna Van Housen yearns for stability &#8212; for something more than just the illusion of a stable life. After spending most of her childhood living a nomadic existence, she&#8217;s privately thrilled that her mother has secured a potentially permanent gig for them in New York. Marguerite, a self-proclaimed medium, will be performing stage shows and seances to earn their keep, with Anna assisting. But even her mother&#8217;s incredible showmanship pales in comparison to Anna&#8217;s natural gifts, which begin to haunt her with disturbing visions and premonitions almost as soon as they arrive in the city. Danger seems to wait at every turn, and it&#8217;s up to Anna to decipher which threats are real and which are only illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, this was a case where the synopsis ended up being more exciting than the actual plot. I enjoyed the 1920&#8242;s setting (very reminiscent of Libba Bray&#8217;s <a title="The Diviners" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-diviners/"><em>The Diviners</em></a>, although perhaps less detailed) and couldn&#8217;t help being intrigued by Anna&#8217;s unorthodox job as an illusionist, but never felt like I got the suspense I was promised. While still a fairly enjoyable read, <em>Born of Illusion</em> fell short of my expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2885"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To elaborate on that statement, I have to point out that my notes for this book contain a lot of complaints that nothing is really happening. I mean, it seemed like things were happening, sure. Some seances go wrong, with Anna&#8217;s abilities going haywire and making it difficult for her to hide them. She finds herself being chased down alleyways by shadowy figures. She keeps having terrible nightmares of her mother in danger. <del>She becomes embroiled in an exasperating love triangle.</del> These are all things that make you feel like the plot is moving, when really it isn&#8217;t. Mostly, Anna suspects that something bad is about to happen and sets about trying to uncover it before it&#8217;s too late. It&#8217;s less suspenseful and more of an ongoing discourse on Anna&#8217;s private suspicions, which she rehashes over and over again in her head, punctuated by brief action here and there that truthfully felt like it was over before it even began. For some reason, the characters are blind to all the myriad clues littered all over the place. If you&#8217;re looking for a harrowing mystery, look elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s made very clear from the beginning that Anna&#8217;s mysterious father is supposedly the legendary Harry Houdini, which I think was the point where I started to feel a prickle of irritation. This is probably going to sound weird, but it actually annoys me when real historical figures are incorporated into fictional events. It always comes off as presumptuous to me, not to mention risky, because it&#8217;s so hard to get it right. In this case, the whole Houdini connection might have been bearable, even logical, if Anna and every other person in the book didn&#8217;t spend all their time mentioning it. A substantial portion of Anna&#8217;s internal conflict revolves around the identity of her father; she&#8217;s always wondered about him and whether her mother was telling the truth, but at the same time she&#8217;s developed an extreme dislike for having her own skills compared to that of Houdini. She doesn&#8217;t want her entire identity to hinge around possibly being his illegitimate child, which her mother has used as both a marketing ploy and as a way to rationalize Anna&#8217;s talent as a magician. I get it, I do. But EVERYBODY talks about this throughout the story and I was almost as sick of it as Anna, who already spends a lot of time contemplating it in her inner monologue without having it frequently discussed in dialogue as well. Again, I GET IT. I DO. STOP TALKING ABOUT IT NOW. Argh.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Probably the most compelling thing going on here is Anna&#8217;s difficult, complicated relationship with her mother, Marguerite Van Housen, who has issues with sharing the spotlight. Anna&#8217;s always lived in Marguerite&#8217;s shadow, yearning for her approval and secretly harboring fears that one day her mother will leave her behind. She has so much admiration for Marguerite, but also a lot of insecurities because of their relationship. There&#8217;s also the fact that Marguerite is a fraud and Anna is the real thing &#8212; she can sense the feelings of others and sometimes catches glimpses of the future through visions and prophetic dreams, while her mother&#8217;s &#8216;gifts&#8217; are just a very well-constructed act. They&#8217;re both very strong personalities in different ways and share a love for performing, but Anna starts longing for more of the spotlight and Marguerite refuses to be upstaged. The tension between mother and daughter is executed just right, in my opinion.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a highly anticipated read for me, and certainly not a terrible one, but not anywhere near what I was expecting. It was definitely the kind of situation where I spent a lot of time tapping my foot impatiently as I waited for everyone in the story to finally catch up and figure out what was going on. I was disappointed to find that <em>Born of Illusion</em> didn&#8217;t deliver on the suspense and mystery it promised. That being said, it does an amazing job bringing the glittering 1920&#8242;s to life without overwhelming you with intense detail, and Anna&#8217;s world of stage lights and sleight of hand is certainly intriguing.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m extremely excited to spotlight one of my favorite authors this week as part of the <a href="http://nuzsaysitwithbooks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Indie &amp; Self-Published Author Event</a>: the awesome A.K. HÃ¶st! Today I&#8217;m reviewing her latest book, <em>Hunting</em>, and tomorrow I&#8217;ve got an interview with the author to share with you &#8212; plus a giveaway :) Which I am peer pressuring you into entering, because you can&#8217;t miss such great books. It&#8217;s just wrong, you guys.</h4>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hunting.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2293 alignleft" alt="hunting" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/hunting.jpg" width="149" height="228" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>TITLE</strong>: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13456081-hunting" target="_blank"><em>Hunting</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Andrea K. HÃ¶st</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 264 Pages</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ash Lenthard doesnât call herself a vigilante. Sheâs merely prone to random acts of derring-do, and occasional exhibitions of tomfoolery. Her friends, the Huntsmen, have never stepped over the line while patrolling the streets of Luinhall.</p>
<p>That was before the murder of Ashâs beloved guardian, Genevieve.</p>
<p>Now, Ash Lenthard is out for blood and even when the hunt sends her to the palace, on a collision course with a past identity she would do anything to forget, Ash cannot, will not, back down.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This isn&#8217;t just a fantasy book. It&#8217;s a <em>fantasy murder mystery</em>. How do you resist?? I mean, it has roof running, tree climbing, strategic gossip, undetectable poisons, shapeshifting mages, secret identities, and VENGEANCE. I can&#8217;t imagine what else you might want, except maybe an amazing female lead&#8230; WHICH IT ALSO HAS. If you&#8217;re not sold yet, I have no idea why. <em>Hunting</em> contains everything I love about Andrea K. HÃ¶st&#8217;s fantasy novels, from incredibly detailed world building to great, complex characters. Read on for more!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2255"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a few constants in life, one of which is that I can always count on A.K. HÃ¶st to deliver a female lead that won&#8217;t disappoint me. The author has this to say about the protagonist of hunting: &#8220;<em>My need for a heroine capable of getting herself out of her own scrapes produced Ash Lenthard, who does not so much kick ass, as tap-dance across the heads of her enemies.</em>&#8221; Does she ever! Wily, resourceful, street-smart Ash has left her painful past behind, shedding her skin and becoming a boy who flies across rooftops with her band of Huntsmen. I loved that Ash is never sitting still. She&#8217;s always up and doing something, making the most out of what she has at her disposal. I love that she goes for what she wants instead of twiddling her thumbs. It gets so tiresome reading books in which the characters remain inert for long periods of time, whether it&#8217;s due to hesitation or insecurities or what-have-you. This is definitely not the case with Ash.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Plus she made me laugh, and frequently. Ash is one of those characters who is either getting herself into shenanigans or finding herself dropped right in the middle of them, and watching her extricate herself from situations ranging from awkward to dangerous is truly entertaining. She&#8217;s self-possessed, focused, and a born leader. I admired her confidence. (I&#8217;ve had really good luck recently with female protagonists who go around dressing like boys and then subsequently running circles around them. Also see: <a title="Scarlet" href="http://novelideareviews.com/scarlet/"><em>Scarlet</em></a> by A.C. Gaughen.) I also loved her relationship and banter with Rian Thornaster, the man she reluctantly teams up with to investigate Genevieve&#8217;s murder. They were more than a match for each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of my favorite things about this author&#8217;s fantasy books is her world building, which is so detailed that it boggles the mind. Ash&#8217;s world is no different; it&#8217;s a fully realized universe, and delving into it is akin to visiting a foreign country. You have to learn the language, figure out the nuances of its culture. It&#8217;s an exercise in discovery that occasionally proved to be a challenge due to the sheer volume of new things to absorb and process. I don&#8217;t mind a challenge, but keep in mind that there are no training wheels. The same has been true of other fantasy books I&#8217;ve read from this author, and I think it adds to how real they end up feeling. I loved the world introduced in <em>Hunting</em>, especially the complex relationship and balance between the gods, the people, and the land, which were all connected and intertwined. I read a lot of fantasy so it&#8217;s always refreshing to see new concepts and ideas in a genre where a lot of tropes are often re-used. Just another thing I&#8217;ve come to expect when I read A.K. HÃ¶st!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It takes a bit of an adjustment period to orient yourself in the world of <em>Hunting</em>, which is pretty complex. Lots of words, names, and cultural details to learn, but it&#8217;s a worthwhile endeavor. Ash Lenthard is an unforgettable heroine you can&#8217;t help rooting for, whether she&#8217;s falling down wells or protecting the people she loves. You may also like <em>The Medair Duology</em> (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9837154-the-silence-of-medair" target="_blank"><em>The Silence of Medair</em></a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10493660-voice-of-the-lost" target="_blank"><em>Voice of the Lost</em></a>), also by Andrea K. HÃ¶st, and the first of her fantasy novels I ever picked up. (I loved them too!)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>:Â Ron Irwin</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Literature/Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>:Â Digital ARC, 320 pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: June 4th, 2013 (Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin&#8217;s Press)</p>
<p>As a teenager, Rob Carrey was a champion sculler and was offered the opportunity to attended Felton, an elite boarding school with a famous rowing team. Once there, Rob clashes with hisÂ privilegedÂ schoolmates andÂ reluctantlyÂ joins the elite 5 person crew known as the God Four. Now an adult andÂ on a flight home after working on a documentary in South Africa, Rob finds a letter in his mail from an old classmate and crew member talking about their year at Felton and asking Rob to come to their reunion. The letter triggers memories of thatÂ faithfulÂ year which took aÂ tragicÂ turn. C<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.5em;">onfronted with his past and realizing just how uncertain his future is, Rob is forced to deal with the trauma of his past and the current turmoil he faces in life.</span></p>
<p>I found the story to be very slow moving. It was clear that the slow placing was intentional and I felt like it made the reader forced to focus more on the characters and their relationships then the mystery of what happened at Felton all those years ago. The language and descriptions were beautiful. I really felt like I could picture Felton and the river as much as Caroline&#8217;s loft. I found that the book did a good job of moving between Rob&#8217;s storyline from the present with that in the past. I enjoyed how it matched the feelings and parelled situations that were going on at both those times in his life. I don&#8217;t know much about rowing but I felt like the book did a good job ofÂ explainingÂ it, not just technically but also the drive that leads people to row and the sacrifices they make to do this sport.<br />
<span id="more-2048"></span><br />
The characters are all very complexed, this felt very much like a character driven novel to me. The story does a great job at slowly revealing and explaining why Rob, Connor, Ruth, Jumbo, Wads and Caroline are all so damaged (because yes, this is a book about very damaged people). I did enjoy how the story slowly revealed what led to these characters being the way they are. The focus of the story was mostly on Rob and Connor at Felton and Rob and Caroline in the present, but I still got a sense of who theÂ surroundingÂ cast was and why.Â You feel the pain of these characters, you understand why they are the way they (even if you don&#8217;t sympathize with them).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the story and Rob still weren&#8217;t able to completely draw me in. I was interested but not captivated and ended up at times wishing the story moved more quickly. The story was just too slow for me. I didn&#8217;t mind the dark tone of the novel but that combined with the slow moving story felt too heavy for me. I also had wished that we had been given a little more at the end.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re a fan of character novels that slowlyÂ revealÂ themselves and their story, thenÂ <em>Flat Water TuesdayÂ </em>is a book for you!</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">Thank you to St. Martin&#8217;s PressÂ for making <em>Flat Water Tuesday</em>Â available for review via NetGalley!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Libba Bray</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA, Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 592 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evie&#8217;s little parlor trick has gone just a little too far this time. The strange, inexplicable ability to learn a person&#8217;s secrets by &#8220;reading&#8221; their possessions has never gotten her into this much trouble before. Apparently most people don&#8217;t appreciate having the skeletons in their closets unceremoniously dumped out on the street. Evie finds herself exiled to her bachelor uncle&#8217;s home in New York, if indeed it can be called exile in the first place. It&#8217;s the Roaring 20&#8242;s, after all &#8212; the streets are teeming with glamorous Ziegfeld girls, crooks, and flappers, and Evie finally feels free. Never mind that Uncle Will is the stodgy owner of an occult museum filled with creepy things. Evie can handle the trade-off. She lives for the bright lights and the perpetual undercurrent of excitement, until that excitement turns deadly. A series of disturbing, ritualistic murders prompts the authorities to call on her uncle&#8217;s expertise in the paranormal, and Evie finds herself on the trail of a killer. Can her gift help solve the case?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weighing in at just under 600 pages, <em>The Diviners</em> will seriously test your endurance as a reader. If you can handle the slow start, Evie&#8217;s crackpot schemes (plus annoying signature phrases such as &#8216;pos-i-tute-ly&#8217;), and a string of VERY creepy moments, this book is sure to take you on a wild ride through an authentically recreated 1920&#8242;s Manhattan and an occult murder-mystery that will make you want to leave the lights on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1316"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s address Evie first. I thought she had some really funny moments, and I liked that she was far from a reactionary heroine, but I just never really ended up seeing her as much of a heroine in the first place. I found myself loving the supporting characters a lot more than Evie. The character development and nuanced back-stories for the other members of this book&#8217;s rather large cast were by far more compelling than Evie herself. I was constantly annoyed by how tactless, frivolous, or just plain ridiculous she was being. She improves towards the end, gaining some maturity and equilibrium, and we do see a promising side to her that finally comes to the surface, but she was never my favorite. It&#8217;s hard to get into a book when the main character makes you want to slap her around. I stayed for the others, and just kind of shoved Evie to the background. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t appreciate a heroine with spunk, but man. She just really gets on your nerves after a while. I guess it takes a certain personality to get along with her? I mean, this girl was still making me mad right down to the last chapters, when she should have been easier to forgive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And now for the length of this book. Guys, it&#8217;s pretty long. It starts off with a deliciously creepy first chapter, though. It definitely snagged my attention from the start. But then Evie came along, which is when my attention began to wander. I just don&#8217;t have much patience for her. I cheered when she got to New York and other characters began appearing; I loved how deeply the author delved into their intertwined lives and what brought them to the big city in the first place. Oh, and I&#8217;m CRAZY for Memphis and Theta &#8212; I love these two SO HARD. I hope we get more of them in the next (gigantic) book. The book really shines in this department, in my opinion. The brilliant supporting cast makes up for Evie being irritating. That being said, you may have a hard time keeping up with all the names and roles being batted around. I don&#8217;t mind a big group of characters, but I realize this might not be everyone&#8217;s cup of tea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The supernatural aspects of the book are exceedingly well crafted. I&#8217;m impressed, honestly. It&#8217;s epic, it&#8217;s frightening, and it&#8217;s handled with a lot of skill. By the end of the book, it becomes evident that this is only the beginning of something greater, something that will take our cast of characters and put them through hell. It&#8217;s all the more impressive when you consider that the villain in this book is already larger than life &#8212; what more could be waiting in the wings?? It just sends a chill down my spine, seriously. Speaking of the villain, if you&#8217;ve read Erik Larsen&#8217;s Devil in the White City, you&#8217;ll recognize a lot of similarities with a real life serial killer&#8230; it just makes it that much creepier. I like to be creeped out (as long as the lights are still on&#8230; /coward) so I thought the scary bits were just excellent. Hats off to Libba Bray for making it all so very convincing, just the right mix of the factual and the fictional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1920&#8242;s setting was evidently researched with incredible depth. It&#8217;s another part of the book that was done well. It kind of goes overboard at times with the 20&#8242;s era jargon &#8212; sometimes I had absolutely no clue what Evie and co were even saying. It gets tiresome over the course of 600 pages, although now I have the strange urge to incorporate, &#8220;And how!&#8221; into my vocabulary&#8230; (that wouldn&#8217;t be TOO bizarre, right??)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m taking off a star mostly because Evie is just not the best main character ever, and for the length of the story; at times it just drags, with a lot of time spent on bringing the setting to life. This isn&#8217;t a big deal, and it&#8217;s certainly not as mind-boggling as, say, <a title="Stormdancer" href="http://novelideareviews.com/stormdancer/" target="_blank"><em>Stormdancer</em></a> with its minute descriptions of people&#8217;s clothing and etc. However, to balance a plot and a setting of this scope, the action needed to be paced at a faster clip for me. Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed it, especially in the latter half of the book. I will be continuing with the series and keeping my fingers crossed that Evie becomes more tolerable in the second and third installments. If you never got enough of the opulent, glamorous world of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> and if you enjoy a dash of the eerie, then <em>The Diviners</em> will be a worthwhile read for you!</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Nova Ren Suma</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC (via NetGalley and Dutton Juvenile), 368 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RELEASE DATE:</strong> March 21, 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first time Lauren saw her, the girl was staring out of a poster proclaiming that she was missing. Her name was Abigail Sinclair, and she&#8217;d disappeared one night from the summer camp where she was training to be a counselor. Seventeen years old, her entire existence narrowed down to the clothes on her back and the words &#8216;Endangered Runaway&#8217;, Abby becomes the first of Lauren&#8217;s ghosts. For some reason, this girl is reaching out to her, communicating through waking dreams and fragmented memories. She starts seeing Abby everywhere &#8212; her muddy hand print left on a windowpane, a trace of phantom breath fogging the glass. Abby and her disappearance haunt Lauren&#8217;s steps, and soon enough one missing girl becomes nearly a dozen. Their voices crowd Lauren&#8217;s mind, each one with a story to be told. But why have they chosen Lauren as their connection to a world that has stopped searching for them? As more and more details emerge, Lauren finds herself increasingly entangled in the message the girls are trying to send. But is it a collective cry for help&#8230; or the only warning they can give her?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>17 &amp; Gone</em> plunges the reader into the world of the lost and never found. It&#8217;s a world of very real, very frightening statistics &#8212; of horror stories all the more chilling because they are based on truth. The writing is evocative and surreal, leaving you listening for telltale whispers and footsteps on the stairs. This is a book you just can&#8217;t miss.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1144"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was beyond thrilled to receive an ARC of <em>17 &amp; Gone</em>. (Not kidding about this &#8212; there was a moment of me screaming in my computer chair when I saw I&#8217;d been approved for it, and then there was another moment of me fidgeting with glee and anticipation as it downloaded to my iPad&#8230;) I discovered Nova Ren Suma last year when I read her extremely beautiful, equally haunting <a title="Imaginary Girls" href="http://novelideareviews.com/imaginary-girls/" target="_blank"><em>Imaginary Girls</em></a> and found myself still thinking about it days after turning the last page. True to form, <em>17 &amp; Gone</em> was a mesmerizing experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are so many, many layers to this story that it will probably take me multiple reads to sort through them all. It&#8217;s the kind of book that offers up even more the second time you read it. The truth is woven through Lauren&#8217;s narrative with so much skill that half the fun is unraveling it. But what I loved about this book was how much it made me think. It kept my brain going, ticking along at a furious pace, trying to catch the twists before they came. The beauty of it is that you dive into the novel and into Lauren&#8217;s skin, becoming so immersed that it&#8217;s hard to even see the plot twists coming. You&#8217;re trying to see through the smoke, just like she is. If you end up taking my advice and reading this book, get ready because you&#8217;re in for a trip. (In a <em>good</em>, complex, thought-provoking way.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lauren, our protagonist, is a convincingly <em>real</em> girl. She&#8217;s believable &#8212; has a boyfriend, a best friend, a junker that she drives to school. She stocks shelves after school at her part time job. She dyes her hair. None of these mundane details makes her mundane, per se. For me, it just made the completely unreal elements of the plot have more impact. The degree to which her routine existence is disrupted by the appearance of Abby in the backseat of her car is that much more powerful by contrast. Lauren is initially eclipsed by the impossible things that start happening to her. You cling to how unremarkable she was in the beginning, and you look at her as an ordinary girl, and all the while her own story is unfolding alongside those of the other girls. Then there&#8217;s a point where it hits you with no small amount of force: those other girls, the ones who went missing? They used to be ordinary too, if only on the surface. There&#8217;s more to Lauren than that initial impression we get of her, and she&#8217;s not just the medium through which these girls communicate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So much genius is going on in this narrative. What I realized about a quarter of the way through was that you&#8217;re as much an audience to Lauren&#8217;s inward collapse as you are to the stories of the missing girls. It&#8217;s both frightening and compelling to watch her lose substance even as the girls gain clarity. They start to seem more real to Lauren, and to the reader, with every word on the page. It&#8217;s partially a story about Lauren&#8217;s gradual decline into someone who goes missing from her own life, no matter that her face has yet to appear on a missing poster of its own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But it&#8217;s also a wake-up call to anyone who&#8217;s breezed right by that bulletin board at the grocery store with the faces of runaways and kidnapped children looking out at us from photocopied notices. It&#8217;s a paean to every abandoned search, every vanished girl written off as a runaway, every case closed before its time. The girls who reach out to Lauren implore her to remember, to be a conduit for their unfinished stories, and <em>17 &amp; Gone</em> implores its reader to pay attention. Its plot extends beyond the fictional and into the real world, where hundreds of thousands of girls go missing every year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I realize that this is most likely the shortest review I&#8217;ve ever written (I tend to be wordy, so sue me), but I just can&#8217;t give you anything more without spoiling everything. And this is definitely a book you don&#8217;t want to be spoiled for, because it will seriously wreck the entire experience. I don&#8217;t want to break the spell, so just put all your blind faith and trust in me and go get this book when it comes out. Oh, and pick up <a title="Imaginary Girls" href="http://novelideareviews.com/imaginary-girls/" target="_blank"><em>Imaginary Girls</em></a> while you wait.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book is never static. It shifts in your hands and slips out of your reach just when you think you&#8217;ve figured it out. You think you know what the girls really are, and you think you&#8217;ve worked out why they keep pulling Lauren away from her reality and into their strange in-between world, but then the story changes shape before your eyes. It&#8217;s complicated, an elaborate mind game. And if you appreciate being perplexed, and you can be comfortable with being uncomfortable &#8212; with never knowing if what you&#8217;re standing on is real or illusion, and not having concrete answers for all your questions &#8212; then you need some Nova Ren Suma in your life. Personally, I think everyone does.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>17 &amp; Gone</em> is out on March 21st! A huge thank you to <a href="http://netgalley.com" target="_blank">NetGalley</a> and the publisher for providing me with the chance to read this book before release!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Robin Sloan</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fiction/Literature, Contemporary</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clay Jannon, jobless after the Great Recession, stumbles upon an odd little San Francisco bookstore and finds his humdrum existence forever altered. Suddenly he has a new gig: bookstore clerk. The tools of his trade are an extremely outdated Mac with a too-short keyboard, a leatherbound ledger in which he is instructed to catalog the comings and goings of the store&#8217;s (equally odd) customers, and a ladder with which to scale the towering shelves. His boss, the enigmatic Mr. Penumbra, provides absolutely no explanation for the bookshop&#8217;s unorthodox hours, or the shelves in the very back that Clay is never supposed to so much as peek into. But curiosity is too difficult to resist, and Clay&#8217;s first tentative glimpse of the secretive world behind Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore takes him on the kind of epic adventure he never imagined having. There are conspiracy theories, black-robed cultists, mysterious visitors in the dead of night, the supposed key to immortality&#8230; and books. Ever so many books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a story about the power of human ingenuity, the amazing potential of our digital age, and the timeless magic of the written word. It&#8217;s a must-read for anyone who believes that books and technology are not opposing forces, but can in fact coexist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1234"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Warning: it&#8217;s also an anthem for every kind of geekery imaginable. It&#8217;s for book nerds, gadget people, gamers, Kings and Queens of the World Wide Web. Name any type of nerdiness, and it&#8217;s probably in here. You will definitely not be able to identify with this book if you aren&#8217;t at least a little bit of a geek. Oh, and technophobes beware &#8212; there are many, many references to things only someone unafraid of going digital would be able to understand. That being said, also skip it if you think e-books spell the end for traditional books and booksellers everywhere, because Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore is about exactly the opposite. It&#8217;s about a world where print and the Internet can unite to become something even bigger and better. Essentially, Clay&#8217;s quest to uncover the truth behind the bookstore and the books within could never have been accomplished without both traditional and digital resources. Consider it a book for a generation that grew up with Google and iPods, but also see it as a bridge between the old world and the new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This book was a true delight for me because I am an unrepentant nerd in a lot of different ways. I&#8217;ve loved books and reading since childhood, so I got all the reading-related jokes and asides. I&#8217;ve also been online, designing and coding, since I was in middle school. There is a lot of design talk in the book; one of the biggest pieces of the central puzzle happens to be a font face. Yes, a font face. (Fellow webdesign geeks, rejoice!) So if youÂ  know the difference between serif and sans-serif, if you can look at a font somewhere and know its name without having to think, then you will appreciate Mr. Penumbra intensely. There are also references to the ridiculously nerdy realm of epic high fantasy &#8212; you know, bearded wizards and harrowing quests, singing dragons, rogues and warriors, the works. It&#8217;s a subtle piece of the plot that I&#8217;m sure a lot of people will be able to follow along with (it&#8217;s not a HUGE part of the story, but a lot of humor involves it), but if you&#8217;re familiar with the era of Dungeons &amp; Dragons or play videogames, you will so, SO get it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I think I just owned up to being more of a massive nerd than I ever wanted anyone to know, so I will stop now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, I obviously enjoyed it. The narrative is funny, but nothing complicated. I will describe it as very easily readable, as long as you aren&#8217;t bothered by simple structure and as long as you can keep up with the Internet-related, technology-centric references. I know my technophobe parents would probably look at this book and think it was written in a different language. But it isn&#8217;t a treatise on why the Internet is awesome or why our entire universe will soon be plugged in, gadgetized, and online. It doesn&#8217;t ever try to prove that the era of traditional books is at an end. It&#8217;s a story for readers everywhere, of every sort, whether you still prefer the feel of a hardcover book in your hands or you&#8217;ve transitioned (like me) to digital shelves of digital books. The message in Mr. Penumbra&#8217;s 24-Hour Bookstore is this: books are forever. They are never, ever going away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and that Google can accomplish virtually anything&#8230; which I would complain about, actually, but I can&#8217;t presume to know if everything about Google that appears in this book is true or false, and so I won&#8217;t even go there. I thought a few things were farfetched in that regard, and yet as an optimist when it comes to technology and what it can do for us, there&#8217;s a part of me that is so willing to believe that all of the prospective technology in the book is possible.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Read this if you think compromise exists between a world that is increasingly digital and a past where paper was king. Read this if you&#8217;re a nerd, because it will speak to you on a level that non-nerds can&#8217;t access. (Hahaha *gets shoved into a locker*) But above all, <em>read this if you love books</em>, no matter what kind.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/073_uninvitedguests.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-820" title="073_uninvitedguests" alt="" src="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/073_uninvitedguests-194x300.jpg" width="116" height="180" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <em>The Uninvited Guests</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sadie Jones</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 244 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s Emerald Torrington&#8217;s twentieth birthday, and the grand old country house of Sterne is a whirl of activity as preparations are made for the celebration. Guests are coming to stay, rooms must be readied, a suitably lavish birthday dinner is in the works. There are, of course, the usual mishaps along the way; these pale in comparison, however, to the unsettling news that there has been a railway accident on a branch line not far from Sterne. As the nearest place of possible accommodation, the house (and the hospitality of its owners) are requisitioned to house a group of passengers with nowhere else to go until the railway can arrange further transportation for them. A storm is brewing and the Torringtons have no choice but to comply. But these passengers are not who they seem, and the long night will bring many strange revelations out of the shadows&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-819"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A reviewer on Goodreads very accurately described this book as &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downton_abbey" target="_blank"><em>Downton Abbey</em></a> + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Others_(2001_film)" target="_blank"><em>The Others</em></a>.&#8221; I completely agree. The setting is a country house in the late 18th/early 19th century, and the characters fit the era&#8217;s societal norms and expectations. The story itself is well written, very readable, and also very short &#8212; not even 250 pages long for me in eBook format. It was an interesting read because it&#8217;s got so many different tones to it. It has these Edwardian moments and dramas, but also a pervading sense of something eerie in the air &#8212; a sense that intensifies as the book goes on. But then the eerie bits are offset by moments of almost ludicrous humor as the spotlight falls on each of the characters in turn, especially the youngest Torrington child who decides to use her older sister&#8217;s birthday and the sudden commotion over the railway passengers as the perfect moment to smuggle her pony upstairs to her room. The thing is, you start to get comfortable and maybe even indulge in laughing at the situations the characters end up in as the night progresses, only to feel a chill down your spine because something creepy just happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The creepiness is very subtle and the book is in no way full on paranormal in nature. I think that&#8217;s what made it more effective, honestly. Things that go bump in the night have more power over you when you can&#8217;t see them. There is something threatening and obviously not quite right about what&#8217;s happening at Sterne on the night of Emerald&#8217;s birthday, but the characters can&#8217;t put their fingers on it, and neither can you. You just know it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As for the characters, as mentioned I thought they were well drawn without becoming too long-winded on their personalities or being very obvious about it. Not all of the characters are likeable and I found quite a few to be rather changeable as the story went on, sometimes they were okay and sometimes I just wanted to slap them. The author does a very good job of making sure each character has his or her own agenda, which again is similar to Downton Abbey and will be something you like if you love/obsess over the show as much as I do. The Edwardian setting is immaculately done. The air of mystery and slight creepiness will keep you reading just to find out what the hell is really going on. I did end up guessing the twist before it happened, but I was grateful to see that it was at least a nuanced twist with more to it than I initially thought. Sort of a half-surprise for me, I suppose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It did bother me that some things were resolved a little too neatly, even though the way they were resolved made plenty of sense. Maybe I was expecting some lingering shreds of the mystery that fuels the bulk of this story. A few scenes also dragged on for what seemed forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve ever read H. H. Munro&#8217;s short stories (you can read 22 of them in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1691284.Surprising_Stories_By_Saki" target="_blank"><em>Surprising Stories by Saki</em></a>, which I happen to love), you will draw some parallels. Overall, I enjoyed this one. I&#8217;m rating it an ALMOST 4 stars mostly because the ending was kind of meh and for how long it took to wind down one scene in particular, the only part of the book where I was tempted to skim because I was ever so bored with what was happening at the time. Everything else was great. Fans of Downton and ghost stories will like it as much as I did, I&#8217;m sure.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/072_cavendishhome.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-812" title="072_cavendishhome" alt="" src="http://briar-rose.net/books/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/072_cavendishhome-198x300.jpg" width="139" height="210" /></a><strong>TITLE</strong>: <em>The Cavendish Home For Boys and Girls</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Claire Legrand</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 344 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Victoria Wright likes everything <em>just so</em>. Her room is a masterpiece of organized drawers and labeled boxes. Her hair falls in perfect curls, her clothes are spotless and wrinkle-free. Victoria is the best at everything, and it&#8217;s a full time job. Nothing is more thrilling than a new medal, another line of straight A&#8217;s, or the satisfying feeling of being top of the class for another year in a row. The same could not be said of Lawrence Prewitt, who is Victoria&#8217;s only friend. Or, if you ask Victoria, her on-going project. Lawrence never seems to have his shirt tucked in, and he spends way too much time playing piano when he ought to be studying for an exam. He calls her Vicky and tries to make her laugh. Victoria finds it all rather frustrating&#8230; until Lawrence disappears. The strange events surrounding her best and only friend&#8217;s sudden disappearance prompt Victoria into investigating. And she will need all of her wits (and willpower) to find him again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-811"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While reading, I was immediately reminded of Neil Gaiman&#8217;s <a title="#9: Coraline" href="http://briar-rose.net/books/2009/02/9-coraline/">Coraline</a>, which was also splendidly chilling at times. This book, however, weaves in more of the skin-crawling, disgusting, cold sweat kind of experiences that even an adult would shrink away from. I think the best way to sum it up would be as a nightmarish fable for all Type A personalities out there. And I happen to have a lot of Type A qualities, so I speak from personal experience. Victoria, the heroine, is a child who prefers to be practical in all things. She spirals into despair when she sees a B on her academic report. Many of her conversations with Lawrence, her one and only friend, are admonishments to tuck his shirt in or comb his hair. She&#8217;s your classic Mary Sue/goody two shoes/stone cold bitch. The beauty of the book is that Victoria begins to use the annoying aspects of her personality in order to solve the strange and terrible mystery of Lawrence&#8217;s disappearance. In fact, she can&#8217;t save him without using her personality quirks. She&#8217;s focused, has an organized mind, and has an overwhelming amount of confidence in her own abilities. Victoria knows who she is and how to play by her strengths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But I think the best thing about it is that Victoria has a heart. She does, it&#8217;s there, and even though she doesn&#8217;t ever want to admit it, her heart has room in it for more than just herself. She begins as an anti-heroine and ends as a heroine. Throughout the story, many parallels are drawn between Victoria&#8217;s rigid personality and that of the main villain. These parallels disturb her because she realizes that it&#8217;s true. She sees what she could become, and she backtracks away from it, choosing a different path instead. I thought this was an extremely important lesson for any child who might be reading it. It&#8217;s also a lesson for anyone who likes things just so. How far will you take it? To what lengths will you go to control everything around you?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing I liked was that things weren&#8217;t magically all better in the end. Maybe I&#8217;m mean, but I think children should know that not everything can be fixed and sorry doesn&#8217;t always make it better. Bad things happen and can&#8217;t be erased. We just have to learn from what happened, accept that it did, and use it to become stronger, better people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to say, this book is lovely in hardcover. I am not actually a fan of hardcover books &#8212; I know, I&#8217;m odd &#8212; but this one is an exception to my rule. The illustrations are perfect, for one thing. And then there are the small, creepy details like random tiny bugs appearing between the printed lines on a page that really emphasize the book&#8217;s sinister air. It&#8217;s a middle-grade novel; the protagonist is 12 years old. I wouldn&#8217;t be so quick to label it as appropriate for any particular age group though, except of course anyone under than 12. I say this because <em>The Cavendish Home For Boys and Girls</em> is very, distinctly creepy in many ways. It&#8217;s not just for kids. In fact, there were some creepy details that I thought might be too much for a kid. At least, it would&#8217;ve been for a child with as much of an overactive imagination as mine was back in the day. This is no happily ever after kind of fairytale. But it does have a warmth to it at the very heart, which I think makes it even better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well written, great pacing, and I enjoyed Victoria very much. Well, I wanted to slap her at first, but I was so excited when she started using her Type A nitpicky traits for the powers of good. I recommend this one!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
