<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: K. Makansi</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA/NA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Layla Dog Press</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 281 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">The Famine may be over, but the Resistance has just begun.</p>
<p>When Remy Alexander is fifteen, her older sister is murdered in a cold-blooded classroom massacre. When the Okarian Sector hides the truth behind the attack, Remy&#8217;s family goes underground to join the clandestine and growing Resistance movement. Now, three years later, Remy is beginning to find clues about why her sister was murdered. But at the same time, Valerian Orlean, the boy Remy once loved, is put in charge of hunting and destroying the Resistance. As Vale fights to protect his people and Remy seeks justice for her sister, the two are set on a collision course that could bring everyone together &#8211; or tear everything apart. (From Goodreads)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Sowing takes place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by environmental collapse and a series of devastating wars that has caused a severe population decline. There is safety and prosperity to be found in the Okarian Sector, but these things come at a terrible price: freedom. Almost everything is dictated, beginning with specialized diets tailored to every individual&#8217;s needs and station. Everything is ruled by science and theÂ  Okarian Agricultural Consortium, which is responsible for the breakthroughs in artificial agriculture that ensure its citizens are fed and provided with the best medicine. Not everyone is happy with the way the Consortium handles things; a growing rebellion alleges that what appears to be nurturing is actually manipulative and oppressive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4188"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to start by praising the intricate world building in this novel&#8230; it&#8217;s so detailed and well constructed. You can tell that it was a labor of love for the three authors credited with this story &#8212; that&#8217;s right, &#8220;K. Makansi&#8221; is a pen name for three authors, a mother-daughter team that came together to craft the trilogy. I loved that the world building was so in depth, even though a lot of the scientific lingo was honestly over my head. (I&#8217;m totally more of an artsy, right-brained type so I&#8217;ve never been very good with science&#8230; err&#8230;) The bad thing about this overabundance of technical detail: I had no idea what was really going on with that most of the time and kind of glossed over those parts. The good thing about it: you can tell that these ladies really know what they&#8217;re talking about. The Okarian Sector&#8217;s obsession with the science of food is obviously well researched. It&#8217;s brilliant concept that also serves to be rather frightening as more and more is discovered about the level of control the Consortium has been exercising over the populace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrative switches back and forth between Remy, now living outside the Okarian Sector among the rebel forces, and Vale, the Okarian Sector&#8217;s brightest star. Upon graduating from the Academy with the highest honors, Vale embarked on a mission to bring down the Resistance effort. This makes for some awkward times, since there is a history between the two characters that dates back to the days when Remy and her family were still citizens of the Sector themselves. As far as the narration goes, I liked Remy and Vale equally. To Remy&#8217;s credit, despite the brewing romantic subplotÂ  going on (and the looming love triangle&#8230;), she was pretty focused on the more important task of making sure the rebellion didn&#8217;t tank and burst into flames. I always really dislike it when romance takes precedence over fundamental, legit concerns i.e. surviving in a desecrated world, being part of an outgunned, outnumbered resistance faction, and essentially trying not to get killed every 2 seconds. You know, <em>those</em> things. So props to you, Remy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked both main characters&#8217; voices and the first half of the book had terrific pacing. I think it did kind of lag towards the end, though. My main concern with the writing style was that it did feel rather like an info dump at times, with Remy and Vale both handing out heavy doses of world building early in the story. I felt like I was being told what was happening more than I was experiencing what was happening alongside them. Granted, there is A LOT to cover since, like I said, this is a very intricate setting and there&#8217;s so much to learn about it. Still, I was impressed with the writing for the most part and it&#8217;s certainly a readable narrative. I loved the banter between the characters, especially Remy&#8217;s group of fellow rebels. As a geek, I also liked all the technology, even though I couldn&#8217;t tell you how on earth any of it worked. Whatever, it was still awesome stuff. /disappears into realm of nerdiness</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing I loved: the diversity in the book&#8217;s cast of characters. Definitely refreshing!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tlc-logo-resized.png"><img class=" wp-image-4232 alignright" alt="" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/tlc-logo-resized.png" width="150" height="150" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think one of the most compelling things about <em>The Sowing</em> is how closely this bleak future could resemble our own. There&#8217;s a lot of talk about genetic enhancements, modifications, and the like nowadays. The concepts brought forward in this book could very well be in the cards for us someday. It&#8217;s well worth pondering the possible outcomes. Fans of science fiction will be happy with this one, but it will be even more of a treat for anyone as fond of political intrigue as I am. (It&#8217;s got tons of it! Conspiracies galore! *happy dance*)</p>

<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Stacey Jay</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 256 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The domed city of Yuan is the only safe haven for miles in the harsh deserts of Isra&#8217;s dying planet. The lands outside the dome are prowled by the Monstrous &#8212; mutated beasts like Gem. They were once human, and are now shunned from the cities where those without mutations dwell in privilege and even luxury. Their safety comes at a terrible price, however; a price that Isra knows too well. The blind princess of Yuan keeps many secrets, not all of which are her own. Her path collides with Gem&#8217;s when the starving Monstrous attempt to steal the source of Yuan&#8217;s prosperity and fail. What unfolds is a friendship, and then a love, that could change the fate of their world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m a huge fan of fairytales and an even bigger fan of fairytale retellings, especially creative ones. I&#8217;ve read quite a few of these over the years, but I have to say that <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> is by far the most unique version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> that I&#8217;ve ever encountered. And you know, sometimes I just get this gut feeling about a book&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to explain, but some books I just KNOW I&#8217;m going to love. I read the synopsis and DONE, let me have it RIGHT NOW. This was one of those inexplicable moments of book serendipity for me. (I mean, just read the synopsis&#8230; OF COURSE THIS WAS MEANT FOR ME. Hello???)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3300"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to being the most unique <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> retelling I&#8217;ve ever come across, <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> also holds the record for creepiest use of that fairytale&#8217;s rose motif. Seriously. I challenge you to find creepier roses than the ones in this book. It was only one of the many creative twists the author implemented. In fact, the world building and storyline are so well developed that the original fairytale is more like the bone structure underneath, giving the plot its shape but not constricting it. I&#8217;ve found over time that this is my favorite kind of retelling, because you can still trace it back to its fairytale roots, but it can also stand alone as something entirely unique.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought Isra in particular was a fantastic piece of character development all around. With every revelation, every little piece of her world that turns out to be a lie, she loses her footing but rallies and goes two steps further than she did before. This girl&#8217;s a fighter. Despite being born within the Dome and not having to deal with the unforgiving environs of the desert outside, despite never wanting for food or shelter, Isra is still at quite a disadvantage in the beginning of the story. For one thing, she&#8217;s been blind since childhood, which makes the lies that imprison her all the more difficult to detect. But as the story progresses, and as she forms a bond with Gem and begins to question everything she&#8217;s been forced to accept, Isra just gets tougher and tougher. She&#8217;s determined to deal with things in her own way, with this inherent bossiness that perfectly suits her, but also a deep compassion and empathy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Usually it&#8217;s the Beast that holds Beauty captive, but in this story it&#8217;s the other way around. When Gem and his fellow Monstrous are caught trying to steal the roses that are the heart of Yuan&#8217;s magic, Isra orders her guards to spare Gem&#8217;s life, and he becomes her prisoner. Their relationship starts with them at odds with one another, basically hating each other&#8217;s guts, and I <em>loved</em> that things were so complicated. I also loved that Isra was not necessarily in a position of power just because she was a princess; there are a lot of political machinations at work in this story that thrilled me because I enjoy that kind of thing. She was as much of an outcast in the domed city as Gem, if for different reasons. They&#8217;re both complex characters with secrets and agendas of their own, with a lot of differences to reconcile between them. This made their romance so much more gratifying to me. It was hard-won, and therefore felt more real and worthwhile.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was so impressed with the depth and creativity of this alternate version of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>. If you&#8217;re a lover of fairytales, high fantasy, or even science fiction (this one has a bit of a sci fi twist to it here and there, although the fantasy aspect is more prevalent), then you should definitely give <em>Of Beast and Beauty</em> a try. This is <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> like you&#8217;ve never seen before. I absolutely loved it!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking for more retellings of favorite fairytales? Here are some of my favorite twists on <a title="Cinder" href="http://novelideareviews.com/cinder/" target="_blank"><em>Cinderella</em></a>, <a title="#3: SPINDLEâS END" href="http://novelideareviews.com/spindles-end/" target="_blank"><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></a>, and <a title="#2: EAST" href="http://novelideareviews.com/east/" target="_blank"><em>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</em></a>. Ah, and some shameless plugging: if you remember the <a title="The Round-Robin Project" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-round-robin-project/">Round Robin writing project</a> I announced on the blog last month, then you may be interested to know that the girls and I decided to write an epic fairytale retelling ourselves! So stay tuned for more on that in the coming months :)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Alexandra Bracken</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2013, Disney Hyperion &#8211; eNovella, 85 pages</p>
<p><strong>PRECEDED BY</strong>: <a title="The Darkest Minds" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-darkest-minds/" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America has been ravaged by an epidemic that robbed the population of its children and transformed the ones who managed to survive. This, combined with an economic crash, has left Gabe with very few options in life. His best chance of securing a future for himself is to become a skip tracer, hunting escaped children and teenagers who have broken out of the so-called reform camps. If he collects the bounties on their heads, he might just be able to save up enough to escape his troubled past. But when Gabe captures a young girl who can&#8217;t speak, he discovers that it&#8217;s even harder to just walk away. What if the government is wrong, and these children aren&#8217;t soulless or inhuman? What if giving this girl back to her captors would be the biggest mistake of Gabe&#8217;s life?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely loved this novella! I&#8217;m a huge fan of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> (as some of you might have been able to surmise by now, considering how often I babble on and on about it) and I really feel like this short story is the perfect bridge between the first and second installments. Fans of Zu, rejoice! Masochistic readers who somehow enjoy being Facepunched By Feels, also rejoice! This one is a must-read if <em>The Darkest Minds</em> broke your heart into teeny tiny pieces, then tossed those pieces into a raging bonfire. Just&#8230; be ready for the pain. In fact, start bracing yourself now. RIGHT NOW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3014"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I always really liked Zu in the first book, and running into her again in this novella was a lot like bumping into an old friend. And by bumping into an old friend, I mean finding her on the edge of a wilderness, pursued by ruthless bounty hunters. What I love about Zu here is that she&#8217;s a total scene stealer. We get to know her in a way that we weren&#8217;t able to in book one, because that centered mainly on Ruby. I really appreciated the added depth to Zu&#8217;s character &#8212; you don&#8217;t realize just how mature she is for her age until you meet her again in this story, and honestly I never noticed just how damn sassy the girl is! Even though Gabe is the one narrating, once Zu comes into the picture you really can&#8217;t help but be drawn to her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I ended up loving Gabe too, despite the fact that he comes off as a total douchebag in the beginning. There&#8217;s so much desperation in him, so much pain and bitterness, and I felt like he embodied all the displaced, hopeless people who were forced to live around the Kid-Killer epidemic and the failing economy. Desperation leads people to do terrible things, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that they&#8217;re bad people. A huge theme in the series so far is survival, and there are many different ways to fight for that. Gabe&#8217;s method is to push his feelings and reservations aside in order to become a skip tracer, because he doesn&#8217;t know what else to do. I loved the transformation that took place when Gabe met Zu. I loved that Zu seemed to find this goodness inside Gabe that even he couldn&#8217;t see.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; AND THEN MY HEART ENDED UP IN SHREDS ON THE FLOOR AGAIN. Who didn&#8217;t see THAT coming??</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My warning to you: the e-novella may SAY that it&#8217;s 85 pages long, and it is, but that&#8217;s because it includes the first chapter of <em><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16150830-never-fade" target="_blank">Never Fade</a>, </em>which is out in October. So don&#8217;t end up like me and be totally, completely facepunched by the last chapter, which I didn&#8217;t think even WAS the last chapter. It seriously was like having a door slammed shut in my face. I WAS NOT READY FOR THAT AT ALL. Ugh. I have nothing else to say. I don&#8217;t want to spoil it for you. In fact, I think I&#8217;ll just go curl up in a corner now and continue the slow recovery process. *sniff* If you haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10576365-the-darkest-minds" target="_blank"><em>The Darkest Minds</em></a> yet, GO DO IT NOW. (Hint: we&#8217;re giving it away as part of our birthday bonanza.) Need further convincing, or just want to see me walking around sobbing like an idiot?

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Alexandra Bracken</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Disney Hyperion; Hardcover, 488 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A large portion of the events in <em>The Darkest Minds</em> take place on the road, on the run. It&#8217;s a dangerous chase through an America where most of the nation&#8217;s children have either died from a mysterious epidemic or emerged alive, but forever changed. Ruby, one of the survivors, has been living in an internment camp called Thurmond since she was ten years old. By the time she finds an unexpected escape from Thurmond, Ruby is seventeen and has no knowledge of how to control the strange abilities that landed her there in the first place. This is her story, but a big reason why it works is that it&#8217;s also the parallel story of friendship so strong that nothing can shatter it. When Ruby finds three other &#8220;freaks&#8221; on the road in their beat up black minivan, it changes the course of her entire life. It&#8217;s a lesson in trust, loyalty, and survival. I really feel that the bonds between Ruby, Liam, Chubs and Zu provide the heart of this story. Ruby finds a family, and the reader does too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to articulate my feelings about this book, I have to begin at the end. Simply put, the final moments of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> left my heart in shreds on the floor. Ridiculous! And it&#8217;s even more ridiculous when you consider the fact that I&#8217;d already seen it coming &#8212; I&#8217;d had this theory percolating in my brain from the time I was about 25% into the story, I knew it was going to happen (if not in this book then in one of the later installments), and yet when it DID happen it still had the effect of a massive facepunch to the feels. Seriously, my concluding notes are essentially nothing more than a long string of expletives. It&#8217;s kind of pathetic. But this is the kind of reaction I end up having when a book pulls me all the way under, to the point that I&#8217;m emotionally invested enough to care that deeply about its characters and their situation. It&#8217;s a good thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2815"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wasn&#8217;t sure how I felt about Ruby at first. Honestly, I don&#8217;t think Ruby knew what to think of herself either. She would have these moments when I just wanted to shake her &#8212; get a move on already!! &#8212; but even though Ruby is constantly at odds with her abilities, what made me love her in the end was the fact that she never hesitated to do what was necessary to survive. She doesn&#8217;t like to use her powers (I won&#8217;t tell you about them AT ALL at risk of ruining your experience, but I LOVE them and I was seriously impressed with what Ruby could do), but when it counts, when it&#8217;s down to the wire, Ruby comes through every single time. Even if it will be at great cost to herself, she delivers. And I feel like she was one of those characters I&#8217;ve encountered who had so much genuine growth by the time I turned the last page. I was pretty damn proud of this girl. Well, and also choking back sobs because of that ending.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And Liam! Omg help?? How is this man so adorable?? Many books have that character whose good heart gets them into trouble every time. Their compassion often becomes their downfall, which is always terrible to see because who likes to watch the nice guy finish dead last? I feel that Liam is that guy, but he&#8217;s also <em>more</em>. He&#8217;s a risk-taker, a born leader, but there&#8217;s this vulnerability to him that Ruby finds herself determined to protect. I loved that Liam taught Ruby how to trust, but even more than that I love Liam for being the light that brought Ruby out of the shadows. Liam gives her a reason to be strong. And that&#8217;s when Ruby truly comes into her own, fitting into her skin at last.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">America in the aftermath of the devastating &#8220;kid-killer&#8221; disease is a bleak, practically lawless place. The remaining fraction of the population lives in various levels of poverty, the suburbs abandoned and the highways empty. The author paints a grim portrait of a nation still mourning the loss of its children almost a decade since the first wave of deaths. Most have lost sons and daughters, if not to the epidemic then to the succession of buses that arrived to take the surviving children away. I appreciated the fact that this deadly, often eerie landscape wasn&#8217;t just a painted backdrop for teenage melodrama. Our characters are constantly fighting to make it to the next day, dodging skip tracers who hunt them for the bounties on their heads and even having to battle other fugitives in order to secure a safe place to sleep for the night. This journey is taken one step at a time, and practically every move forward is fought for tooth and nail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s hard for me to resist a book that elicits this much emotion while I&#8217;m reading. I can&#8217;t help loving it. I feel like the best books make that connection with you, and <em>The Darkest Minds</em> definitely resonated with me. The only reason I&#8217;m taking off points is that the book kind of crawls at times while Ruby and crew are on the road. I feel like it could have been a bit shorter without suffering for it. BUT: I was hooked from the very first chapter, and the characters made me love them, and the ending broke my heart. I&#8217;m in this until the bitter end now, guys. I HAVE NO REGRETS. Go read this!!!!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Susan Dennard</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Historical/Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, HarperTeen; eBook, 248 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eleanor Fitt thought her family&#8217;s situation couldn&#8217;t get worse. Since her father&#8217;s death, money has been increasingly scarce, and now Eleanor&#8217;s brother has gone missing, with the only clue to his whereabouts appearing in the form of a letter crushed in the fist of an undead corpse. To make things worse, her mother unwittingly invited a malicious spirit into their home, she&#8217;s falling hard for an inventor of ill repute, and corsets make it extremely difficult to outmaneuver the undead horde. Land sakes!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve heard so much about this series that picking it up was inevitable. I confess to knowing pretty much nothing about it when I requested from the library &#8212; only that it was mostly well received and had something to do with the undead. Guys, you don&#8217;t need very much convincing when it comes to this girl and a good zombie apocalypse. It&#8217;s a really interesting concept because there are, in my opinion, so many different ways to handle it. <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> brings the undead masses to 1876 Philadelphia, and while it was frequently predictable, I still thought it was a fun ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2814"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps that the heroine is easy to get along with. Eleanor Fitt is under a lot of pressure to help undo their formerly affluent family&#8217;s fall from grace. All she has to do is make a good match &#8212; which is easier said than done, because Eleanor happens to feel very strongly about being an independent woman during a time when girls and women were expected to remain resolutely in the background. It&#8217;s a man&#8217;s world, and Eleanor is having none of it. She has an insatiable mind, always brimming with curiosity, which of course gets her into twenty different kinds of trouble on a daily basis. It&#8217;s always nice to see a heroine who gets herself into scrapes but manages to get herself out of them, whether this means using her head or finding the nearest available baseball bat and taking out zombies with it. I liked Eleanor&#8217;s inquisitive nature and her determination to be something more than what society expected of her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also thought it was interesting that there were so many mentions of body image. Early on in the story, Eleanor&#8217;s late father is quoted as having listed &#8216;a fondness for buttered toast&#8217; as one of her few vices. A lady is supposed to appear dainty and eat like a bird, plus there&#8217;s the problem of fitting into an extremely tight corset, so Eleanor is frequently hungry or even regretting taking an extra bite of breakfast. Her mother criticizes her figure, and Eleanor seems plenty aware that she isn&#8217;t the ideal size, but I appreciated that the concept was even included. I feel like it&#8217;s overlooked in other books of this genre; yes, the descriptions of beautiful dresses and tiny waists abound, but what about the problems associated with cultivating that image? To me, Eleanor was more down to earth because she struggled with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the plot was predictable (I was able to guess most of the twists early on, as well as the big reveal), I didn&#8217;t feel especially bothered by it. First of all, I was intrigued by the concept of a zombie horde in the middle of 1876 Philadelphia and enjoyed the inclusion of the Centennial Exhibition as a central part of the story. The steampunk &amp; &#8216;scientific&#8217; paranormal bits were often a bit much and I ended up taking them with a grain of salt, but the author did a great job clearly defining the setting without overwhelming the reader with excessive period detail. It was sort of like&#8230; okay, I don&#8217;t really see how you could really rig an alarm to go off when the undead are near, BUT that&#8217;s fine because the characters are fun and the pacing keeps me from getting bored. (Kind of like those episodes of Ghost Adventures when they hold up some bogus piece of electromagnetic equipment and I just roll my eyes&#8230;) There&#8217;s a lot of action, with the first chapter opening with an undead attack, and there aren&#8217;t any dull moments acting as filler.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the way, I liked Daniel immensely, but he totally punched me in the face with that ending. I mean, I don&#8217;t believe it for a second, but props to the author for choosing that moment in particular to NOT be predictable at all.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An incredibly readable book, <em>Something Strange &amp; Deadly</em> is an enjoyable excursion into an alternate Philadelphia where the dead aren&#8217;t always truly dead. A sassy heroine and a colorful supporting cast make the predictability more bearable. I&#8217;m happy to report that the conclusion of book one definitely has me excited for book two, although I can&#8217;t divulge much more than that without risking spoilers for you all. I&#8217;d say this one is one the lighter end when it comes to zombie books &#8212; if you&#8217;re looking for something really dark and full of feels, try <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8051458-the-reapers-are-the-angels" target="_blank"><em>The Reapers Are the Angels</em></a> by Alden Bell, or <a title="Warm Bodies" href="http://novelideareviews.com/warm-bodies/" target="_blank"><em>Warm Bodies</em></a> by Isaac Marion (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7619057-warm-bodies" target="_blank">book</a> AND <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1588173/" target="_blank">movie</a>) for unexpected warmth and humor!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Kat Zhang</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins; eBook 343 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For longer than they can remember, Addie and Eva have been together. Just like everyone else in the world, they were born as two souls in one body, two completely different people with separate personalities and thoughts. But they soon discover that they aren&#8217;t like everyone else at all, because one of them should have receded during childhood, leaving the other in complete control. Eva, however, is still there &#8212; the ever-present voice in Addie&#8217;s head, unwilling to simply relinquish her hold on life. Her existence could be enough to get them killed, especially in a society where hybrids are viewed as a threat. When they discover that there is a chance for Eva to regain partial control, Addie and Eva are faced with a choice between the safety of being separate and the dangerous possibilities of staying together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took me an entire month to get through this book. Not because it&#8217;s long, or unreadable, but because it is so unbelievably slow. I swear it felt like nothing much happened between the first chapter and the last. I think I&#8217;m joining the minority by disliking this book as much as I did, but man. <em>I just did not get it.</em> The pacing moves at an absolute crawl, the protagonist(s) spend way too much time dithering over what to do next, and quite frankly I thought the world building was virtually nonexistent. I turned the last page and still felt unconvinced as to the necessity of persecuting, purging, and otherwise reviling &#8216;hybrids&#8217; other than a petty vendetta against people who are different. <em>What&#8217;s Left of Me</em> just didn&#8217;t work for this girl, unfortunately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2547"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within the first few chapters, I was already looking for answers that weren&#8217;t being supplied. Other than a brief mention in the synopsis, it&#8217;s hard to be clear on just where all of this stuff is taking place. For the record, it&#8217;s apparently an alternate version of our world, with an alternate history in which everyone is born with two souls. One soul is dominant, the other recessive, and people who don&#8217;t end up losing their recessive soul are considered to be hybrids &#8212; extremely dangerous, and definitely not welcome in Addie and Eva&#8217;s alternate America. Here&#8217;s the thing, though: I have no idea why hybrids are supposedly so dangerous. They never seemed to have any unorthodox abilities, no telekinetic powers or superhuman strength, et al etc. In fact, the only clear advantage I saw in being hybrid was having double the brain power to get through algebra homework faster. (No joke, Addie and Eva actually provide an example of this in the book.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, case in point, if hybrids can&#8217;t really DO anything differently than non-hybrids&#8230; why on earth do we care if they live in our country or not?? <strong>Why exactly are they a threat??</strong> I mean, did I miss something&#8230;? It was made rather obvious that foreigners were NOT wanted because foreign hybrids started a terrible war that nearly wiped out all of humanity. Fine, hybrids made bad choices about nuclear warfare. But the war is over, and yet the government seems to be harboring this borderline childish grudge against hybrids. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s an intended message here about how deeply society can fear and reject what they don&#8217;t understand, but I didn&#8217;t feel like it was executed well at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wait, back to the world building. Which is barely there at all. Like I said, I had no idea at first whether this was a post-apocalyptic version of OUR world or a world of the author&#8217;s fabrication. I had to go back to the synopsis and see that it was indeed an alternate. I personally disliked that I was being forced to grasp at straws here. I wish there had been more clues that this wasn&#8217;t a world based on ours, because I think I would have been less confused and more able to get into the setting right from the start. Of course, I may be the only one upset about this aspect. World building is pretty important to me though, and it&#8217;s hard to portray a dystopia in an alternate world when you only allow your reader a very shallow immersion in that world. It detracts from the atmosphere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked Eva&#8217;s will to survive, and I applauded her conviction to stay with Addie rather than eventually vanishing the way recessive souls are supposed to. She had these flashes of brilliance during which she actually did things; Addie, on the other hand, seemed more recessive in nature than Eva. I&#8217;m not sure what the rules are for deciding which soul is dominant vs recessive, as yet again the world building kind of failed to elaborate on this, but I really questioned how Addie was dominant when she spent more time twiddling her thumbs, hesitating about what to do next, than Eva ever did. My only strong impressions of Addie were during the times she lashed out at Eva for A) wanting to be more than a voice in the back of her head (gasp, how atrocious) and B) wanting to kiss a boy that Addie wasn&#8217;t interested in. ??? ?? ????</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guys, I get the massive conflict that exists when you have two souls trapped in one body. That is actually a really intriguing idea to ponder. I get that it&#8217;s terrible never having private thoughts, never just getting to be you, because you have two personalities. In the end, it&#8217;s hard for either of them to be happy. I just wish this internal conflict had been paired with a plot that was more compelling and a setting that was more defined. Don&#8217;t get me wrong &#8212; I&#8217;m all for thought-provoking books and having to dig a little deeper to find the meaning of a story, but despite trying really hard to get something out of this experience, I&#8217;m sad to say I walked away pretty disappointed. Another case of having an awesome premise but falling short in the execution, in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Karen Thompson Walker</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 273 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>âLater, I would come to think of those first days as the time when we learned as a species that we had worried over the wrong things: the hole in the ozone layer, the melting of the ice caps, West Nile and swine flu and killer bees. But I guess it never is what you worry over that comes to pass in the end. The real catastrophes are always differentâunimagined, unprepared for, unknown.â</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When news breaks out that the earth&#8217;s rotation is slowing down, Julia is eleven years old. It&#8217;s a typical Saturday morning in a typical suburban household, but it&#8217;s one of the last normal days they will ever have. The changes are subtle at first, but become more and more pronounced as the days and nights grow longer and the established laws of both gravity and nature are slowly altered. Along with millions of others on the planet, Julia finds herself fighting to adapt to this new world, where the middle of the night is as bright as high noon and birds can no longer locate true north. Crops die in the blazing sun and freeze in the seemingly endless nights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve seen a lot of mixed reviews regarding this book. Most of the criticism concerns the author&#8217;s liberties with science/physics/what-have-you, and I can understand those criticisms. However, I walked away from <em>The Age of Miracles</em> with a good feeling about what I&#8217;d just read, and I think my favorable reaction stemmed from approaching the book as more of a coming-of-age story than anything else. I stand by my opinion that it&#8217;s not so much about the world ending as it is about Julia&#8217;s life beginning at the end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1677"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Post-apocalyptic and dystopian stories are an extremely popular concept right now, and they have been for quite a while. I think what differentiates this book from the rest is that it&#8217;s a rare account of the kind of apocalypse that happens not with a sudden, earth-shattering annihilation of the world as we know it, but with a collapse that creeps up on humanity by degrees. It&#8217;s a series of slow changes, one adjustment having to be made after another until everything that was once normal has been completely altered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think that it&#8217;s human nature to take comfort in routine and to rely on those familiar rituals as a way of grounding yourself to reality. Whether we are conscious of it or not, we live in a society that is governed by time, with everyone on the clock for some reason or another. Children go to school, adults go to work; our days are divided into tidy segments, between day and night, daylight and darkness. In <em>The Age of Miracles</em>, the first casualty of the apocalypse is time itself. Through Julia&#8217;s eyes, we watch society attempt to reconcile with the changes, to adapt its rhythm to days that stretch from 24 hours to 48 and upwards. There are days when Julia goes to school in the pitch dark because, although it feels like the middle of the night, the slower rotation means it&#8217;s now actually 8am.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What happens when a world that operates at hyper speed is forced to slow down? Things fall apart at a very gradual pace, but they fall apart nonetheless. It&#8217;s inexorable. Julia witnesses firsthand just how much of the order and structure of civilization is based on the clock.Â Through her, we observe the increasing tension between those who choose to adapt to the longer and longer days and those who refuse to. We see not only how humans react to the sun still shining at 10pm, but also how it affects animals and plants. If you tend to imagine the apocalypse as something akin to a big budget film with massive tidal waves and toppling buildings, this is a compelling alternate possibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#8217;t argue for or against the science involved in the plot because I&#8217;m not an expert in the field. I took it all with a grain of salt, focusing mainly on Julia and what was happening to her and all around her. However, I talked about this book with my husband and he was completely incredulous when I described some of the results of the earth slowing because he&#8217;s a VERY logical person and just couldn&#8217;t get past that. I have no idea if the events in the book are impossible or completely inaccurate. Honestly, I don&#8217;t ever want to find out. I cared more about Julia &#8212; about the <em>people</em> in the story &#8212; than I did about the scientific details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real strength of the book lies in its exploration of what life is like despite the fact that the world is ending. The earth may be slowing down, but Julia is still growing up in the process. She&#8217;s eleven years old when the slowing begins, still prone to all the anxieties and hopes associated with being that age and yet also very aware that she might not be able to grow up. The world might not last that long. She sees a rift between her parents that reveals sad truths about their marriage; she encounters love and friendship and loss. All the joys and sorrows of growing up are still very much in full swing, but with the added element of a world coming apart at the seams. This book as many poignant moments, but also a lot of candid questions and observations that are possible specifically because Julia is a child. I was reminded frequently of Alice Sebold&#8217;s <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12232938-the-lovely-bones" target="_blank"><em>The Lovely Bones</em></a>, actually, because of the fact that the narrators of both are very young girls witnessing the breakdown of everything they once knew.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pick this up if you want to see a different take on the world ending and what happens after that. The book turned out to be thought-provoking for me because I wasn&#8217;t really looking for inconsistencies with the laws of physics or concerning myself with what would really happen if the earth&#8217;s rotation slowed down. I treated this as a coming-of-age story, and while some stuff really required a certain suspension of belief, I was able to mostly set that aside. If you foresee yourself nitpicking over the scientific aspects, you may want to pass. Overall, I have to say that it&#8217;s beautifully written and will draw out emotions you never expected to feel for a sci-fi/dystopia read. The Age of Miracles is not just about the apocalypse; it&#8217;s also about the persistence of life even when the end is approaching.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Shandy Lawson</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC (NetGalley), 208 Pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: April 30, 2013 (Disney Book Group)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first time they meet, Ben and Maggie are on the escalator at the mall. But it&#8217;s not really the first time, and it&#8217;s not nearly so simple. In fact, it&#8217;s less of a meeting and more like the beginning of the end, because this is only the first event in a sequence that eventually leads to their deaths. The two are caught in a loop &#8212; a fragment of time that continually circles in on itself, forever winding down to the last, fatal moment when they lose their lives side by side. But neither Ben nor Maggie can be content with simply living and reliving these final days over and over again. Instead, they fight fate. Determined to divert the flow of time and break the loop, they do everything they can to defy what destiny has in store. They&#8217;re on a collision course, tied together by a shared path to destruction. Together, they believe they can alter the ending. But what if being together is what brings them to that destination every time? And what if the key to surviving is surviving apart?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can never seem to resist anything that promises time travel. Throw in some star-crossed love and the prospect just gets better! Shandy Lawson&#8217;s <em>The Loop</em> brings both of these things and more. Ben and Maggie&#8217;s desperate fight to alter their fate is never without the lingering sense of danger waiting just around the corner. Likewise, there&#8217;s never a dull moment. The book could easily be envisioned as a film, in my opinion. I found myself intrigued by the concept of &#8216;loops&#8217; in the flow of time and really became fond of the two protagonists during the time I spent with them. My only complaint here is that the book is so very short &#8212; just a little over 200 pages. Those two hundred or so pages are fueled by adrenaline, but expect to be left with some unanswered questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1569"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is rare, but I liked both Ben and Maggie equally. Their personalities mesh very well. I usually develop a stronger attachment to one character in particular, and in situations like this where two are sharing the spotlight, it can be tough to balance one against another. I was really relieved to see that the entire book wasn&#8217;t going to be one lame lovestruck moment after another. That would&#8217;ve seriously detracted from the sense of impending doom that hovers over the story and made it less compelling. Fortunately, Ben and Maggie are repeatedly thrust into difficult situations &#8212; situations that test how resourceful they can be. They&#8217;re forced to face challenges together, but also individually. I liked being able to see how each one fared when striking out on their own. There are points throughout the story when this happens. In the beginning, Ben and Maggie try separating to see if that will do anything to break the loop. And then, the closer they come to that final day, they start to separate for a different reason: neither one wants to see the other die. And if remaining apart might minimize that risk, they&#8217;re willing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I argue that the relationship between Ben and Maggie isn&#8217;t anything like the Insta-Love Phenomenon that we&#8217;re so often subjected to in many YA books these days. Yes, there&#8217;s an instant attraction, but since we begin the book at the beginning of yet another loop in their timeline, it&#8217;s really impossible to tell how much of that attraction is really instantaneous. When Ben sees Maggie again, both for the first time and for the hundredth time, he&#8217;s drawn to her but doesn&#8217;t remember her from the last time they went through this scenario. They&#8217;re only able to retain bits and pieces of their repeated experiences, and Maggie is better at retention than Ben. I liked that he developed that affection with Maggie despite not remembering. To me, this meant there was something real between them, an unbroken connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It made sense to me that they would feel strongly about one another. Some may complain that they developed those feelings over the course of two days, but I&#8217;m pointing out to you that those two days have spooled back on themselves over and over again by the time the story begins for the reader. Just imagine NOT feeling anything &#8212; friendship or more &#8212; for someone you kept repeatedly getting stuck in a time loop with. Over and over again, Ben and Maggie meet on an escalator in the mall. Over and over again, they spend the next two days trying to escape their inevitable death. Over and over again, they watch each other get killed. There are some strong emotions bound up in something like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought the concept of being snagged in a time loop was very interesting. You really can&#8217;t help hoping that these two will figure out a way to break free of the destiny waiting for them. The problem is complex: they can&#8217;t remember everything they&#8217;ve tried before, and consequently can&#8217;t remember everything that&#8217;s resulted. Then there&#8217;s the fact that neither fate nor time has any desire to let Ben and Maggie alter their course. They find themselves battling an inexorable current, one that&#8217;s determined to push them in the direction they want to avoid. Overall, I thought the plot was well-paced; you can hear the clock ticking, you can feel that desperate rush of fear and determination that characterizes every decision made. I wasn&#8217;t confused, and I wasn&#8217;t ever bored. Even if the book wasn&#8217;t short, I think I would&#8217;ve finished it in one sitting. I wasn&#8217;t entirely happy with the resolution, though. I wanted something more. And in the end, I had several questions still left unresolved. For example, why was Maggie so prone to getting caught in loops? Was Ben drawn into the loop because of Maggie?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m rating this high because I enjoyed it. It was short, true. But since I think <em>The Loop</em>&#8216;s brevity does add to its high octane pace, I&#8217;m not rating down for brevity. While the science fiction aspect of time travel and loops is intriguing in its own right, I admire Ben and Maggie for putting heart into something that might otherwise have come across as cold and clinical. You know, and they know, that their chances of surviving and breaking the loop are terrifyingly small. They continue to fight, though, and you continue to hope that they&#8217;ll succeed, because they win you over. Pick this up if you want a short, suspenseful read with a science fiction twist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you so much to Disney Book Group and NetGalley for the ARC!</p>

<p><strong>SERIES</strong>: <em>The Checquy Files, #1</em></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Daniel O&#8217;Malley</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Science Fiction</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 487 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine this: a young woman wakes up in the middle of a London park surrounded by a ring of dead bodies. She&#8217;s got two black eyes, numerous wounds and bruises, and a note in her jacket pocket that says, <em>&#8220;Dear You: The body you are wearing used to be mine.&#8221;</em> Thus begins the whirlwind adventure of Myfanwy Thomas, or at least the new Myfanwy Thomas &#8212; the one who has absolutely no recollection of who she is. Using the letters and copious research of her previous self, she embarks on a mission to discover who betrayed her, leaving her to die. She learns that she is, in fact, a member of a top secret organization that is the equivalent of a secret service for the supernatural. She also learns that she has supernatural powers of her own, powers that make her both a valuable asset and a dangerous enemy. In a hidden world masked by bureaucracy and clever media manipulation, Myfanwy must navigate through a host of obstacles and match wits with those who want her conveniently dead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I absolutely loved this book. Not only is it fresh, imaginative, and entertaining, it&#8217;s also terribly funny. Myfanwy proves to be a fun, fierce heroine who takes no prisoners, whether she&#8217;s fighting it out in the field or in the boardroom. Definitely an instant favorite for me. Read on to find out why!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1341"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone who&#8217;s ever had to deal with working in an office, sorting out massive piles of paperwork and juggling an inbox full of emails, will instantly make a connection with this book. As Myfanwy figures out, her former self was actually a Rook, a pretty high-ranking member of the world&#8217;s most secretive network of supernaturals &#8212; a group that calls itself the Checquy. They have hidden offices in their native England and branches throughout the world, all part of the grinding machinery that keeps phenomena like aggressive ectoplasm and murderous vampires from getting out of hand. This all requires a great deal of administrative acrobatics, and it seems Myfanwy was the ringmaster. Scrubbed of her memory, she goes back to the office having no clue what the hell is going on. Thankfully, she has a very capable secretary and a purple binder full of the former Myfanwy&#8217;s detailed notes. She relearns what she needs to know, and quickly, because there isn&#8217;t time to lose. Someone out there wants her dead, after all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love Myfanwy. She&#8217;s both clever and hilarious. While her predecessor, the shy and often nervous Myfanwy Thomas, was known throughout the Checquy as the person managing things in the background, the new Myfanwy turns out to be ten times more commanding and capable than she was before. She has no qualms about using her powers, which are unique and potentially deadly, and she very quickly takes an assertive hold over her role as Rook. Her awkward moments cracked me up. Her badass moments had me cheering. And you know what? It was really nice reading a book about a confident, capable female lead WITH NO ROMANCE INVOLVED. (Ah, but there IS an adorable pet rabbit named Wolfgang.) So yeah, this book has a fabulous heroine. The story is both a tale of self-discovery and one of self re-invention, as Myfanwy&#8217;s two personas come together to make an entirely new force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plot moves along at a fast clip, lots of action and never a minute of boredom. There is, however, a lot to take in. Myfanwy herself is re-learning the ropes of her position as Rook, including all of her myriad duties and enough standard protocol to fill a library. All she&#8217;s got to go on are her predecessor&#8217;s letters and notes, compiled in the months before she lost her memory. It never felt like an info dump for me, but there will be a lot for you to remember and keep track of, tons of names and significant Checquy-related information that is relayed through the former Myfanwy&#8217;s letters and the new Myfanwy&#8217;s day to day discoveries. I thought it was a fascinating world to fall into, but it&#8217;s possible that some will be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of things to digest in the first half of the book. There were also some supernatural elements that seemed a bit of a stretch, but I was okay with them. The book&#8217;s overall hilarity and entertainment value overshadow its small flaws.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a must-read if you&#8217;re a fan of science fiction or fantasy, or if you&#8217;ve ever worked in a corporate machine&#8230; because you will totally get all of Myfanwy&#8217;s struggles through Checquy corporate bureaucracy, including all the business lunches, meetings, and conference calls that are emblematic of the modern office environment. The book has a very wry sense of humor that clicked with me really well. I swear I spent so much of this book laughing like a complete idiot, and it was so much fun that I barely noticed the pages going by. I&#8217;m really glad I picked it up, but now I&#8217;m suffering because the sequel isn&#8217;t out yet and I want more. UGH. Anyway, I highly recommend <em>The Rook</em> &#8212; it hooks you from the first line and keeps that momentum going until the end. GO GET IT NOW. RIGHT NOW. It&#8217;s smart, it&#8217;s funny, and I&#8217;m definitely going to read it again.</p>
