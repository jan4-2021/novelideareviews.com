<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Shandy Lawson</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC (NetGalley), 208 Pages</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: April 30, 2013 (Disney Book Group)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first time they meet, Ben and Maggie are on the escalator at the mall. But it&#8217;s not really the first time, and it&#8217;s not nearly so simple. In fact, it&#8217;s less of a meeting and more like the beginning of the end, because this is only the first event in a sequence that eventually leads to their deaths. The two are caught in a loop &#8212; a fragment of time that continually circles in on itself, forever winding down to the last, fatal moment when they lose their lives side by side. But neither Ben nor Maggie can be content with simply living and reliving these final days over and over again. Instead, they fight fate. Determined to divert the flow of time and break the loop, they do everything they can to defy what destiny has in store. They&#8217;re on a collision course, tied together by a shared path to destruction. Together, they believe they can alter the ending. But what if being together is what brings them to that destination every time? And what if the key to surviving is surviving apart?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can never seem to resist anything that promises time travel. Throw in some star-crossed love and the prospect just gets better! Shandy Lawson&#8217;s <em>The Loop</em> brings both of these things and more. Ben and Maggie&#8217;s desperate fight to alter their fate is never without the lingering sense of danger waiting just around the corner. Likewise, there&#8217;s never a dull moment. The book could easily be envisioned as a film, in my opinion. I found myself intrigued by the concept of &#8216;loops&#8217; in the flow of time and really became fond of the two protagonists during the time I spent with them. My only complaint here is that the book is so very short &#8212; just a little over 200 pages. Those two hundred or so pages are fueled by adrenaline, but expect to be left with some unanswered questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1569"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is rare, but I liked both Ben and Maggie equally. Their personalities mesh very well. I usually develop a stronger attachment to one character in particular, and in situations like this where two are sharing the spotlight, it can be tough to balance one against another. I was really relieved to see that the entire book wasn&#8217;t going to be one lame lovestruck moment after another. That would&#8217;ve seriously detracted from the sense of impending doom that hovers over the story and made it less compelling. Fortunately, Ben and Maggie are repeatedly thrust into difficult situations &#8212; situations that test how resourceful they can be. They&#8217;re forced to face challenges together, but also individually. I liked being able to see how each one fared when striking out on their own. There are points throughout the story when this happens. In the beginning, Ben and Maggie try separating to see if that will do anything to break the loop. And then, the closer they come to that final day, they start to separate for a different reason: neither one wants to see the other die. And if remaining apart might minimize that risk, they&#8217;re willing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I argue that the relationship between Ben and Maggie isn&#8217;t anything like the Insta-Love Phenomenon that we&#8217;re so often subjected to in many YA books these days. Yes, there&#8217;s an instant attraction, but since we begin the book at the beginning of yet another loop in their timeline, it&#8217;s really impossible to tell how much of that attraction is really instantaneous. When Ben sees Maggie again, both for the first time and for the hundredth time, he&#8217;s drawn to her but doesn&#8217;t remember her from the last time they went through this scenario. They&#8217;re only able to retain bits and pieces of their repeated experiences, and Maggie is better at retention than Ben. I liked that he developed that affection with Maggie despite not remembering. To me, this meant there was something real between them, an unbroken connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It made sense to me that they would feel strongly about one another. Some may complain that they developed those feelings over the course of two days, but I&#8217;m pointing out to you that those two days have spooled back on themselves over and over again by the time the story begins for the reader. Just imagine NOT feeling anything &#8212; friendship or more &#8212; for someone you kept repeatedly getting stuck in a time loop with. Over and over again, Ben and Maggie meet on an escalator in the mall. Over and over again, they spend the next two days trying to escape their inevitable death. Over and over again, they watch each other get killed. There are some strong emotions bound up in something like that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I thought the concept of being snagged in a time loop was very interesting. You really can&#8217;t help hoping that these two will figure out a way to break free of the destiny waiting for them. The problem is complex: they can&#8217;t remember everything they&#8217;ve tried before, and consequently can&#8217;t remember everything that&#8217;s resulted. Then there&#8217;s the fact that neither fate nor time has any desire to let Ben and Maggie alter their course. They find themselves battling an inexorable current, one that&#8217;s determined to push them in the direction they want to avoid. Overall, I thought the plot was well-paced; you can hear the clock ticking, you can feel that desperate rush of fear and determination that characterizes every decision made. I wasn&#8217;t confused, and I wasn&#8217;t ever bored. Even if the book wasn&#8217;t short, I think I would&#8217;ve finished it in one sitting. I wasn&#8217;t entirely happy with the resolution, though. I wanted something more. And in the end, I had several questions still left unresolved. For example, why was Maggie so prone to getting caught in loops? Was Ben drawn into the loop because of Maggie?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m rating this high because I enjoyed it. It was short, true. But since I think <em>The Loop</em>&#8216;s brevity does add to its high octane pace, I&#8217;m not rating down for brevity. While the science fiction aspect of time travel and loops is intriguing in its own right, I admire Ben and Maggie for putting heart into something that might otherwise have come across as cold and clinical. You know, and they know, that their chances of surviving and breaking the loop are terrifyingly small. They continue to fight, though, and you continue to hope that they&#8217;ll succeed, because they win you over. Pick this up if you want a short, suspenseful read with a science fiction twist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thank you so much to Disney Book Group and NetGalley for the ARC!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Jacquelyn Mitchard</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 218 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The world is different at night. Allie and her two closest friends, Rob and Juliet, know this better than anyone. The three all share the same genetic condition: Xeroderma Pigmentosum, a fatal allergy to sunlight. The only world they can truly live in is the one that emerges when the sun goes down. They have been friends forever, banding together against the disease that has every possibility of claiming their lives before they can even begin to truly live. But being unable to tolerate daylight doesn&#8217;t prevent the trio from trying to get as much out of life as they possibly can. They explore the streets and unearth buried secrets by the light of the moon, having the run of Iron Harbor from dusk until the last few hours before dawn. But it&#8217;s when they take up parkour, a stunt sport involving climbing and vaulting off tall buildings, that the thrill factor hits the ceiling. And it&#8217;s because of this need for a thrill that they find themselves witnessing something they shouldn&#8217;t have seen, what no Daytimer would ever have known about: murder.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea behind this book is, I think, brilliant. It covers rarely explored territory, promises a suspenseful plot. This is why I was drawn to it in the first place. And it isn&#8217;t that the plot lacks action or mystery, because it has those things &#8212; it just all suffers from poor execution. <em>What We Saw At Night</em> falls victim to a lot of tension that ultimately fizzes out far too soon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-1041"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book does do a fantastic job of giving you an insider&#8217;s look at what life is like for a teenager with XP, I think that it captures that with incredible accuracy and a lot of relevance. Allie is a decent heroine who does her share of teenage quibbling but otherwise is very good about not annoying me. Did I find myself wishing she would stick up for herself more, and not just in her head but also out loud? Sure. Did I wonder why on earth she was friends with Juliet (a bitch) and Rob (practically a non-entity) aside from the fact that they all have XP? Absolutely. But she was okay, and she evolves from being reactive to proactive by the end, so I considered her redeemed to an extent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were some genuinely creepy moments in this story, moments that had me glancing nervously over my shoulder despite the knowledge that it was all purely fictional. The thing that makes the creepiness work is that the chilling bits could all be very real. The villain is someone who could exist very easily right down the street from you, someone you might even know. If you&#8217;ve ever watched a Dateline special, you&#8217;ll understand. It&#8217;s those small details that scare you, the telltale signs that something isn&#8217;t quite right. That someone is following you. That someone is watching your every move, leaving these subtle hints because they know you&#8217;re going to find them. They want you to find them. Allie, our protagonist, starts experiencing all these things right after being the only one to pursue the fact that she and her friends probably saw someone get killed. She&#8217;s determined to find out what happened, and the killer knows it. It&#8217;s terrifying to think that Allie, not quite seventeen, is facing down so much evil essentially on her own. This is a villain who is smart, resourceful, an adept liar, and masquerading as a decent person. He has a respectable job, a well-known family, kids of his own. He&#8217;s also a complete sociopath, and he will stop at nothing to make sure Allie never talks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the suspense, no matter how good it is, gets mired in choppy narrative and conversations that veer away from the topic way too often. Yes, I realize that normal conversations between normal teenagers (or normal people in general) don&#8217;t conform to rigid scripts, but this was really just too much for me. There are inside jokes that are explained after the fact but which leave you feeling more excluded than part of an intimate trio of friends. An intimate trio of friends who, by the way, never managed to convince me that they really were as close as they claimed to be. For one thing, Allie seems to be the outsider in the group from page one. And it&#8217;s not just me who thinks that, Allie does too. She feels inadequate compared to gorgeous, agile, practically perfect Juliet, and she feels neglected by Rob, who never seems to notice her the way he notices Juliet. (She is, of course, attracted to Rob, because this is YA and we NEED to have a love triangle.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the story begins, there are already these growing rifts between the three that anyone could spot a mile away. For one thing, Juliet is a straight up d-bag in every sense of the word. At least, this is how she came off to me. She&#8217;s manipulative, quite a bit condescending, and constantly tries to convince Allie that her thoughts and ideas are ridiculous. What kind of a &#8220;best friend&#8221; is that? And don&#8217;t get me started on Rob, who is barely a character at all because he only exists in conjunction with either Allie or Juliet and has no real personality of his own. The girls believe in him, and therefore he is a real boy. That&#8217;s about all there is to him.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What really ruins things though is that all of the really good moments, the suspenseful bits, the chilling revelations, get lost in the shuffle and become ineffective as a result. The tension and the element of fear should be carried through with faster pacing, otherwise it doesn&#8217;t feel urgent or even mildly dangerous. Like I said, the narrative is choppy and jumps around from spans of days to entire months going by, sometimes with nothing crazier happening than Allie taking AP Lit over the summer and reading tons of books. I mean, a story about a murder and a sociopath serial killer should make you so anxious that you can&#8217;t put the book down. You&#8217;re that worried about what might happen next, when the killer will strike or try to silence Allie forever. He does some crazy things, some really disturbing stuff comes to light, but it&#8217;s all so few and far between. You forget about it between one incident and the next. It&#8217;s not until closer to the end that the loose narrative starts to wind you up, when things start hitting Allie hard and fast. It&#8217;s a short book as it is, but most of it felt wasted to me. There are like three pages where she rehashes things she learned from a criminal justice textbook, just an info dump of massive proportions. It&#8217;s stuff like this that dulls the book&#8217;s otherwise sharper edges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was also bothered by the fact that I turned the final page only to discover that this is, in fact, going to be a series. I was thinking it would end in one installment, but nope. Do I think it could&#8217;ve been one book? Yes.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 2.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Take out all the extraneous crap and focus on the action, imminent danger, and very real, believable fear and you would have one hell of a good standalone book, I think. But this fell short for me in a big way. I&#8217;m pretty sad about it because I expected more.</p>
