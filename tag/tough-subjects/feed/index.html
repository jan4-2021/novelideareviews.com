<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Mindy McGinnis</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction/Dystopian</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: September 2013, Katherine Tegen Books</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 320 Pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>RELATED POST</strong>: <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days Tour Recap</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a world where fresh water is rare enough to kill for, Lynn and her mother spend their days on the roof of their house. The focus of every day is defending the pond on their property, which is their main source of water, and which is consequently a prime target for others who are desperate to survive. Life is a battle for Lynn, and it only intensifies when shots in the dark and smoke on the horizon signal both a beginning and an end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Admittedly, this book would&#8217;ve flown under my radar if not for my good friend <a href="http://gypsyreviews.com" target="_blank">Charlotte at Gypsy Reviews</a>, who told me I needed to pick it up while I was at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/"><strong>Dark Days Tour</strong></a> signing last month! So thanks for the recommendation, Charlotte!! I was lucky enough to meet author Mindy McGinnis during the event &#8212; she signed my book (<a href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/photo_2-2/" target="_blank">and tore the title page</a>, but she drew a smiley face next to it so all was well in the end! haha) and also signed a bookmark for me to give away! <strong>Details on how to win are at the end of this post :)</strong> And be sure to read <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">my recap of the Dark Days Tour</a> stop in Vegas for what Mindy had to say about her debut novel!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3911"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>Not a Drop To Drink</em> is pretty stark on the surface &#8212; Lynn and her mother are fighting for survival in a bleak, dystopian society. I know a lot of us have had enough of dystopia in YA these days, but I have to say that this one stands out from the crowd. Not only is the survival aspect very realistic and believable, it&#8217;s also infused with an undercurrent of hope and the possibility of change for the better.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that it was such a no-frills narrative. The writing is readable but not so simplistic that it detracts from the emotional content. You really get a feel for the kind of life Lynn leads, which is not forgiving or easy at all. The environment is harsh, riddled with dangers that need to be guarded against at all times. From a very young age, she&#8217;s been forced to sink or swim. Sometimes when I read dystopia, it&#8217;s really hard to get into the atmosphere because too many frivolous things litter the story &#8212; love triangles, insta-love, extraneous drama &#8212; all the usual suspects that make it seem like they&#8217;re too busy being emo to actually get to the business of surviving. This isn&#8217;t the case with <em>Not a Drop To Drink</em>. Every minute of every day is precious, and every day in itself is hard won.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The protagonist, Lynn, has never known a world that didn&#8217;t demand this kind of struggle. She&#8217;s been raised by her mother, learning to grow a thick skin and move through life without hesitating to kill if that&#8217;s what it takes to survive another day. They defend their pond against man and beast &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t matter who. And because she&#8217;s been raised to trust no one but her mother, Lynn is a character that sometimes displays a really callous personality. It kind of bothered me at times just how unfeeling she could be, but it&#8217;s worthwhile to remember that this is all she&#8217;s ever been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until events cause massive change in her life, Lynn is resistant to any type of change at all and even more resistant when it comes to depending on other people. She&#8217;s wary of going beyond the small circle of her comfort zone, and the crazy thing here is that what&#8217;s &#8220;comfortable&#8221; for Lynn would probably be SUPER uncomfortable for a big baby like me, haha. The good thing is that she undergoes this massive amount of growth by the time the story ends. She&#8217;s still tough as nails, and she still has a very black and white, straight up survivalist outlook on life, but her heart becomes more open. She experiences love and friendship that temper her previous experiences of loss and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a romance in this book, but it&#8217;s pretty low key. The highlight of the story is Lynn&#8217;s relationship with a little girl named Lucy who teaches her both how to care for another person and how to be cared for in return. I really appreciated this aspect of the story, as well as Lynn&#8217;s growing acceptance and eventual friendship with her neighbor, Stebbs. Overall, what makes this novel is not the stark reality of a world without fresh water and what that means; instead, it&#8217;s about fighting for the people you love.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a solid standalone novel and one that I recommend for anyone looking for a true survival story &#8212; the author knows her stuff! As she mentioned during the Dark Days event, her actual lifestyle is very similar to Lynn&#8217;s! (Not because she shoots people from her roof if they come near her pond&#8230; haha!)</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Carolyn Jess-Cooke</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Fiction/Literature (Adult)</p>
<p><strong>RELEASE DATE</strong>: August 13, 2013, Delacorte Press</p>
<p><strong>SOURCE</strong>: Digital ARC (Netgalley)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a child psychiatrist, Anya Molokova is familiar with the demons that can plague an unstable mind. She even has firsthand experience, having suffered the death of her own daughter from mental illness. But when she meets a small boy named Alex, she takes on the most baffling, disturbing case of her career. For Alex, demons are real. They congregate in the corners of his room, speak to him in broad daylight, and can manifest at any time. He tells Anya that his best friend is one such demon called Ruen, but he doesn&#8217;t tell her that Ruen wants him to do terrible things. Things like hurting other people, and hurting himself. Is Ruen a product of the child&#8217;s psychosis, or something else entirely?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I seldom venture into adult lit these days, but I&#8217;m always interested in books that deal with child psychology because I work with kids on a daily basis. Of course, there was also the possible occult angle, which made me want to read this one even more. <em>The Boy Who Could See Demons</em> was a relatively short read that covered a number of tough subjects &#8212; from the tumultuous history of Northern Ireland to the debilitating effects of mental illness. While at times it had the tendency to sound like an academic paper or someone&#8217;s doctoral dissertation, it also unfolded with excellent pacing that kept me guessing until the very end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2886"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that this book always kept me on uneven footing. I could never completely decide if Alex&#8217;s demons were real or illusion, and I spent the entire book collecting clues. It&#8217;s always refreshing when I can&#8217;t predict what&#8217;s going to happen. All the isolated incidents that come up in Anya&#8217;s investigation are linked, and I could see the pattern, but I really didn&#8217;t have a definitive guess until it was over. (I guessed right, but that conclusion was pretty hard-won.) Alex&#8217;s case combines events and details that are frightening precisely because they could feasibly be related to all the trauma he&#8217;s experienced, BUT you&#8217;re never sure if that&#8217;s the whole reason. There&#8217;s this lingering possibility that it could really be demons, that hell could truly be as accessible as opening a door and finding the room crowded with malicious spirits only he can see. I was afraid for Alex, and increasingly so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alex&#8217;s relationship with Ruen, his 9,000-year-old demonic &#8216;friend&#8217;, was a major focal point of the story for me. Their interactions constantly embodied the idea that good and evil vary greatly based on perspective. Ruen&#8217;s ability to make Alex question preconceived notions of right and wrong were downright scary at times. Even scarier was the fact that all of this could be due to the machinations of Alex&#8217;s mind and not a supernatural entity at all. In the end, which is more frightening? The thought that Alex was being influenced by a demon, or the thought that Ruen&#8217;s influence was entirely the product of his delusions?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The narrative alternates between Anya&#8217;s journal entries and Alex&#8217;s, which I didn&#8217;t mind. What bothered me was that Anya&#8217;s entries often verged on the cold and clinical, reading more like an article in a psychiatry text than the narration of a real person. Her entries also had this annoying tendency to flip back and forth between present and past tense, which was confusing and detracted from the journal entry effect. Another thing that bugged me about Anya&#8217;s side of things was the addition of this weird romantic subplot that I felt was unnecessary. Not only were those parts distracting, they also seemed pretty irrelevant. I wish Anya&#8217;s narrative had focused solely on her investigation of Alex&#8217;s condition and how it affected her without crossing over into a possible romance with his social worker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alex&#8217;s half of the story was told in a more convincing, accessible way. You really get to know him and the nuances of his personality. Much of the plot&#8217;s unpredictability lies in the way Alex tells his experiences, because children are known to tell things the way they see them, and it&#8217;s really unsettling to hear a seven year old talk about the demon whispering in his ear&#8230;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a pretty compelling story that invites you to look at good versus evil from a different angle. I spent the whole time trying to piece the puzzle together and wasn&#8217;t able to come up with a solid theory until it was practically over. <em>The Boy Who Could See Demons</em> was short, readable, and did a good job of keeping me guessing. I will say that there is a lot of commentary on Northern Ireland that kind of went over my head since I&#8217;m not very familiar with the history there, so you might want to brush up on facts before you read just to get more out of the experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks to Delacorte Press and Netgalley for the ARC!</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 1999, Viking Juvenile; Paperback, 228 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Colie dropped her extra pounds, she also dropped a way of life. Everything changed when she and her mother lost weight. Now her mom is known to the entire world as Kiki Sparks, fitness superstar, and she barely recognizes her. Reinvention hasn&#8217;t come as easily to Colie; she&#8217;s always had trouble making friends, and that was one thing that didn&#8217;t change when everything else in her life did. So when she finds herself packed off to spend her summer at the beach with her aunt, she isn&#8217;t expecting very much. Certainly not friendship, and definitely not love.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I&#8217;ve said before, being able to predict what will happen doesn&#8217;t really bother me when I&#8217;m reading Sarah Dessen. In fact, it&#8217;s a big reason why I like reading her books. I pick them up because I want something familiar and comforting, and not to have my world turned upside down. I&#8217;ve always liked that she&#8217;s so good at sneaking something thought provoking into an everyday, ordinary situation. That being said, while I liked <em>Keeping the Moon</em> just fine, I didn&#8217;t connect with it as I have with other books by this author. I&#8217;d have to say it was the most predictable yet, and for the first time ever, this bugged me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2816"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve often heard Dessen books being criticized for being formulaic, and I&#8217;ve never denied that they are, for the most part. It&#8217;s true that you can definitely pick up a formula of sorts as you read more of her novels. Dessen girls are always troubled in some way, whether it&#8217;s an inner conflict or a problem caused by outside sources. She&#8217;s usually searching for her true self, sorting out what that means even as she deals with the other issues in her life, which can be a challenge when you&#8217;re in transition between childhood and adulthood. Meanwhile, Dessen boys tend to defy being judged by their covers. They&#8217;re always something more than what they appear. By the end of the story, revelations take place and lessons are learned. But what makes that predictability easy to accept is that the characters are always so likeable. They have quirks, personalities that are real and relevant, and there&#8217;s always something special about each one that helps them stand out. Some of the most endearing fictional people I&#8217;ve met so far have actually come from Dessen novels, and honestly I&#8217;ve yet to meet any main characters of hers that I didn&#8217;t like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s the same with Colie, the protagonist of <em>Keeping the Moon</em>, but the difference this time is that liking her didn&#8217;t equate to connecting with her. I don&#8217;t know what it was, but something was missing here. I didn&#8217;t dislike her, but I didn&#8217;t love her either. There just wasn&#8217;t a spark there. Normally by the time I finish a book by this author, I feel like the main character is my best friend &#8212; that&#8217;s just how deeply you get to know them, and how well drawn they usually are. All the other Dessen girls I&#8217;ve encountered so far have these really distinctive voices that distinguish them, and their unique stories, from one another. Colie, however, was hard for me to get a good grasp on. This made it hard to like this book as much as I&#8217;ve liked the others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This one definitely has the quirkiest cast of characters so far, in my opinion. This was actually my first impression of the book: that it had the craziest people in it! Colie&#8217;s mother is a fitness guru and the star of countless infomercials, so of course her personality is a bit over the top. Then there&#8217;s Colie&#8217;s eccentric Aunt Mira, whose house is crammed to the rafters with secondhand items that all have something mildly wrong with them &#8212; and all the flaws are labeled, of course.Â  Morgan and Isabel, Colie&#8217;s co-workers at Last Chance, aren&#8217;t extensively quirky but are definitely possessed of big personalities to make up for it. There are a lot of colorful people here, and I definitely love quirky characters, but once again I didn&#8217;t really feel that magical connection with them. &#8230;Wait! There was one exception: <em>Keeping the Moon</em>&#8216;s resident Dessen Boy, Norman. Ugh, I LOVE NORMAN. SO MUCH. He was my favorite person in this book. I thought he was an example of the right kind of quirky &#8212; a bit odd, but loveable because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think it&#8217;s the first of her books to be set in the seaside town of Colby, which is also the setting for <em>Along For the Ride</em> and her latest, <em>The Moon and More</em>. I&#8217;ve come to love Colby so it was interesting to see it in its earlier days!Â  It&#8217;s also one of her older novels, published in the late 90&#8242;s, and my experience has been more towards her newer titles so that may be part of why this one didn&#8217;t work as well. I didn&#8217;t recognize anyone from other books this time around since I&#8217;ve never read any of the stories that take place prior to it but now I&#8217;m wondering if I might see familiar faces from Keeping the Moon if I revisit Colby in the later novels&#8230;?</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the first time ever, the predictability and comforting familiarity I normally love in a Dessen title came off as a bit disappointing. I&#8217;d say this is my least favorite of them so far, but only because it was the book I had the most difficulty connecting with. I feel like if this was one of the first I&#8217;d read from her, I wouldn&#8217;t be as big a fan as I am now&#8230; so I&#8217;m glad I read The Truth About Forever first. I am happy to see, though, that the author seems to have improved more and more with every book; after all, this is one of her earliest novels. Her more recent books are very near and dear to my heart and that has a lot to do with how adept she is when it comes to balancing that predictability with characters that surprise me and insights that I wasn&#8217;t expecting. I&#8217;m still a Sarah Dessen fan, but <em>Keeping the Moon</em> was only okay for me.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2006, Viking Juvenile &#8211; Hardcover, 383 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Annabel was the girl who had everything &#8212; a loving family, a dazzling best friend, popularity. But things have changed, and now she&#8217;s an outsider, watching her former best friend Sophie tear her reputation to shreds and walking on eggshells at home while her sister slowly recovers from an eating disorder. There are so many things Annabel wants to say, so many truths to tell, but it seems like no one is listening&#8230; not even Annabel herself. When she strikes up an unexpected friendship with fellow outsider Owen Armstrong, every day becomes a lesson on what it means to tell the truth, as well as how to face it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you were wondering whether my Dessen binge had finally ended or not, here&#8217;s your answer: nope! Still working through her entire bibliography like a madwoman, and <em>Just Listen</em> is definitely one of my absolute favorites from her so far. Like <a title="Lock &amp; Key" href="http://novelideareviews.com/lock-key/" target="_blank"><em>Lock &amp; Key</em></a>, this one deals with some tough issues. Sarah Dessen handles it with her usual touch for making these issues relevant and realistically portrayed. Annabel&#8217;s story covers toxic friendships, bullying, &#8216;mean girls&#8217; and eating disorders, as well as the struggles of getting through a family crisis and how hard it is to be completely honest, with others and with yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2632"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to start with Owen, because I love him. I just do. I can&#8217;t even explain it coherently. Like other Dessen boys, he&#8217;s got a history that he isn&#8217;t proud of, and most people give him a pretty wide berth. I&#8217;ve always liked that Sarah Dessen&#8217;s characters are more than what they seem on the outside, which is a big theme in this book especially. Owen believes in not judging, in always telling the truth, which is partly due to mistakes he&#8217;s made in the past. This is in sharp contrast to Annabel, who has a policy of holding everything in rather than telling people how she really feels. I loved Owen&#8217;s unflinching dedication to always telling the truth, no matter how much that truth will hurt, and no matter how difficult it is to do it. He makes a good case for honesty. How many hurtful situations could be avoided just by telling the truth? How much do we withhold from the people in our lives because we&#8217;re afraid of the consequences? Just Listen explores the nature of lies, whether they&#8217;re white lies or full blown deceptions. Owen&#8217;s personal crusade to be honest with his own feelings and opinions is exactly what Annabel needs, but also what she fears.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As I mentioned earlier, <em>Just Listen</em> deals with toxic friendships &#8212; specifically, recovering from them. I really identified with this because I&#8217;ve been through it before. It made the reading experience really painful for me at times, just because remembering how you&#8217;ve been hurt is sometimes even worse than the actual experience. I know firsthand how hard it is to even acknowledge that a friendship isn&#8217;t actually good for you. And even though you know deep down that it&#8217;s for the best, it&#8217;s ten times harder to let go. Like everyone else, I haven&#8217;t always been a good friend, and I&#8217;ve made some regrettable choices in the past when it comes to my friendships. But Annabel&#8217;s situation really touched me because I know what it&#8217;s like to <em>lose</em> your best friend. I know the emptiness left behind when you let that person go. Yes, you&#8217;re better off without them, but on the other hand you&#8217;re also faced with the prospect of not having anyone to fill that role in your life. It&#8217;s a lonely place to be. I liked that Annabel eventually recognized that Sophie wasn&#8217;t what she needed, but also that there was a lot to learn and discover about herself through that relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I also loved this book&#8217;s focus on music and how deeply it can be embedded in your memories, good or bad. There are some songs that always take me back to that particular place and time, that invoke all the emotions of the moment as though I&#8217;m experiencing it all over again. The power of music is a big deal in this book, and it ties in so well with Annabel&#8217;s process of learning how to <em>just listen</em>, without jumping to conclusions or shying away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Whether it was a song, a person, or a story, there was a lot you couldn&#8217;t know from just an excerpt, a glance, or part of a chorus.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to include this quote in my review because in a lot of ways, it also describes my relationship with Sarah Dessen books. I had so many misconceptions about her writing before I took the plunge and started actually reading instead of just lingering on the fringe of things. I&#8217;ll be up front with you: I&#8217;m 26 years old and I read more YA than adult fiction, which means that I often find myself frustrated with all the hormones and etc flying around in books primarily meant for teens. I won&#8217;t go into a long treatise on why I prefer YA over books that actually are meant for people my age, because that would take me off on a tangent. But what I want to say is that Dessen&#8217;s storylines and characters are NOT typical YA, at least not in my opinion. I keep picking up her books because I know now that she&#8217;s going to surprise me by being thought provoking in the most unexpected moments, about the most ordinary and everyday experiences. She talks about real problems and real emotions. Yes, her books follow a familiar format. Yes, there is usually a happy ending. But I kind of like knowing good things are coming. I like watching her characters grow, and I like <em>knowing</em> they&#8217;re going to grow and change.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a really personal connection with this book and its themes &#8212; sorry for the rambling! Honestly, there is so much I want to say about this book that I&#8217;m leaving out because I&#8217;m trying really hard not to saddle you with a 10-page essay. I highly recommend this one to current Dessen fans as well as anyone who is thinking of reading her books but isn&#8217;t sure where to start. I&#8217;d say this is my third favorite, after <em><a title="The Truth About Forever" href="http://novelideareviews.com/the-truth-about-forever/" target="_blank">The Truth About Forever</a></em> and <a title="Along For the Ride" href="http://novelideareviews.com/along-for-the-ride/" target="_blank"><em>Along For the Ride</em></a>.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 283 Pages (2008)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby knows how to fend for herself. After all, she&#8217;s been doing that for the past few months. Scraping a living together from her after school job, living alone in the little yellow house she used to share with her mother, she finally has a degree of independence. But the show is over, because her mother is missing and now Ruby&#8217;s estranged sister has reappeared in her life after years of not being there when they needed each other the most. Cora and her husband Jamie take Ruby back with them to their palatial home in the suburbs, enroll her in a prestigious private school, and seem determined to give her everything she lacked throughout her childhood. But why is living the easy life so much harder than getting by on her own?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby, the product of a brokenÂ  home and a single parent who isn&#8217;t much of a parent at all, is an entire world removed from the protagonist of <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, which was my first ever Sarah Dessen book. While Macy has a roof over her head, money in the bank and a pretty secure existence, Ruby has had to cope with abuse and neglect. When her sister whisks her away from what she knows, it&#8217;s like being relocated to an alien planet. <em>Lock and Key</em> deals with some tougher issues than I&#8217;ve seen so far in this author&#8217;s work, and while it had some flaws, I still think it handled those difficult topics very well, and that it ended with a familiar sense of hope that is iconic of Dessen&#8217;s books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2259"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, I have to mention that I love the way Sarah Dessen writes standalone novels that are still set in the same universe, so we get to catch glimpses of characters from other books (and wildly wave to them, if you&#8217;re a massive nerd like me) and get that extra little boost of comfort and familiarity. If you&#8217;ve read <em>The Truth About Forever</em>, some of Macy&#8217;s co-workers from Wish make a cameo appearance and it all takes place in the same neighborhood so Ruby&#8217;s sister and brother-in-law actually live in a neighborhood designed by Macy&#8217;s parents. I personally really like little details like this. It&#8217;s a lot like running into someone you know after years of not seeing each other, and having this resurgence of good memories from the last time you met. I enjoy seeing how all these different characters, with all their different stories and situations, can still be subtly connected to one another even in the smallest ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ruby wasn&#8217;t as endearing to me as Macy was, though I can&#8217;t put my finger on just why. I did admire her strength and her courage, and I did appreciate that she was this really tough girl having to learn how to trust others instead of alienate herself from them. I guess I just didn&#8217;t bond with her in the same way I bonded with Macy, who was slightly more accessible as a character. I did love Nate and thought he was pretty well-written; he surprised me several times, and his personality was just the thing Ruby needed to offset her own. The supporting cast, especially Ruby&#8217;s brother-in-law Jamie, were also wonderful and as memorable as I expected them to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What I feel this book does best is portraying the fact that there are many different kinds of abuse. It doesn&#8217;t have to be physical. In Ruby&#8217;s case, she suffered from a neglectful parent even more than a physically violent one. One of the characters also deals with verbal abuse and neglect of a different kind, because a parent can still pay attention to their child, but in all the wrong ways&#8230; which is still neglecting their needs. Both Nate and Ruby are products of divorce, and you are able to see two different ways in which divorce affects children. I think these tough issues resonated with me more than Ruby did because as a teacher I&#8217;ve unfortunately seen a lot of this in my classroom. It&#8217;s saddening, but also makes me want to do something to help, and I liked that the characters strive to help one another &#8212; I especially like that they learn to reach out to others for that help instead of constantly internalizing or trying to deal with things on their own. So, I&#8217;d like to give the author props for handling sensitive subjects well and not trying to sugarcoat them or disguise them as something else.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing <em>Lock &amp; Key</em> accomplishes is an exploration of the different shades of being a family and the true definition of that word. Ruby struggles with this concept for the majority of the book, slowly learning what family means and how to accept the family that she has. Dealing with trust and abandonment issues makes this an uphill battle for her, but it was something that I found really heartening to watch unfold. There are so many different kinds of families, and not everyone in your family needs to be bound to you by blood. Friends are family too, and even broken families are still families. I was especially touched by Ruby&#8217;s relationship with her sister Cora because I&#8217;m a sister myself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn&#8217;t have very many problems with the story, though I did think it was more predictable than <em>The Truth About Forever</em>. I thought Ruby and Nate&#8217;s private school, Perkins Day, was a little bit too utopian and therefore rather unrealistic, but it wasn&#8217;t something that I couldn&#8217;t relegate to the background while I focused on the characters and their growth instead. My other problem was with the resolution of things with Nate, which felt kind of unsatisfying to me but at the same time was appropriate in a lot of ways, so I couldn&#8217;t rail against it as much as I wanted to. I mean, the way things went with him made a lot of sense, even if it wasn&#8217;t what I wanted to happen, and I can accept that. I guess. Maybe. LOL.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Dessen offering takes us through darker territory than most of her books, with a protagonist that has to pick up the pieces after a lifetime of abuse and instability. But it&#8217;s also infused with strong messages about breaking the cycle of abuse, as well as the meaning of family, and how the ties we forge with other people have so much power to help and to heal.</p>
