				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3250" alt="pagebanner" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/pagebanner.png" width="590" height="43" /></a>Hi everyone! Paola here, writing to you from the edge of the NaNoWriMo abyss~ I&#8217;m on hiatus this month while all this crazy novel-writing business is going on, but I really wanted to recap the awesome weekend I just had with my even more awesome friend Charlene (<a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Bookish Whimsy</a>) at <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013</a>! So I&#8217;m stepping away from my word processor for a second to spam you with pictures and flip out over all the great authors we spotted out in the wild on Saturday. I feel like it&#8217;s my civic duty. (Also maybe I&#8217;m kinda going cross-eyed after staring at my unfinished novel for so long&#8230; err&#8230;.)</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-4140" alt="VVBF_010" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_010-682x1024.png" width="223" height="335" /></a>I brought my fancy camera because obviously I&#8217;m a professional at this memory-making business. Pay attention. Now, we got there pretty early &#8212; like 45 mins before the first YA panel was supposed to start &#8212; and had lots of moments of serendipity such as mystically finding the parking garage when we weren&#8217;t even looking for it. This is how we knew it was meant to be. (Btw, Charlene and I had the best, most fantastic three-day slumber party EVER.) For once the weather was actually GORGEOUS in Las Vegas, something that only happens once a year when the planets align. The festival was all outdoors, so this was fortunate. We ran into our friend <a href="http://theshybooknerd.blogspot.com" target="_blank">Stacie</a>, too! She had the cutest rolling suitcase ever&#8230; girl meant business, okay?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-3913"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We attended three panels; Charlene chose the first one so naturally we ended up hearing about serial killers. She has a dark side, folks. It was a GREAT panel, starring Kate Brian, Michelle Gagnon, Gretchen McNeil, Jennifer Lynn Barnes, Jessie Humphries &amp; J.R. Johansson who all discussed what it&#8217;s like to write about all things creepy. We discovered that Jennifer Lynn Barnes has an insane fear of snakes that is rivaled only by my own intense, irrational fear of insects. It was super interesting to hear how the authors got into such dark subjects and why they love writing about gritty topics versus fluff and unicorns.</p>
<div id="attachment_4146" style="width: 222px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007.png"><img class=" wp-image-4146" alt="VVBF_007" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_007-682x1024.png" width="212" height="319" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Claire Lazebnik signed a book for me to give to my beloved Alix! And her next Austen retelling is Persuasion, because this was Fate. Capital F. Did I mention this lady is awesome??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our next panel was Classical Remix, and I absolutely loved this one because my spirit animal Stacey Jay was part of it, talking about her AMAZING Beauty and the Beast retelling, <em>Of Beast &amp; Beauty</em>, which I read earlier this year and fell in love with. Except now I think I love the author more than the book! Since I&#8217;m a huge fan of retellings, it was so much fun finding out what motivated these authors to take a classic or a fairytale and twist it into something else. Among the speakers on the panel were A.G. Howard, Claire Lazebnik, Gena Showalter, and Mary Lindsey, and just about everyone agreed that retelling the original story had a lot to do with wanting to delve deeper into the characters and the plot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were others who said that they chose to retell the story because they didn&#8217;t agree with how things went in the original &#8212; for example, Stacey Jay chose to write an alternate version of Shakespeare&#8217;s <em>Romeo &amp; Juliet </em>(<em>Juliet Immortal</em> and <em>Romeo Redeemed</em>) because she always thought that Romeo was a massive jerk, and Claire Lazebnik had some things she disliked about Austen&#8217;s <em>Mansfield Park</em> that she was able to change up a bit in her own version, <em>The Trouble With Flirting</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_4143" style="width: 208px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002.png"><img class=" wp-image-4143" alt="VVBF_002" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_002-682x1024.png" width="198" height="298" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Blurry but still adorable photo of me with Kasie West&#8230; she sat down in front of me at one of the panels and I may have flipped out a little. Just a little though. I have dignity. (Errr)</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oh, and hey writer friends! Some great advice I wrote down about writing from the lovely ladies on this panel:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t hold yourself to some kind of accountability, the book just won&#8217;t get done.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;A character can get into trouble by coincidence, but they can&#8217;t get out of trouble by coincidence.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both of those are from Eileen Cook, author of <em>Getting Revenge on Lauren Wood</em>&#8230; it&#8217;s a contemporary retelling of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>! (Awesome, right??)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And btw, there better be some confetti being thrown around right now for the fact that I actually took any notes at all, never mind that they&#8217;re extremely cryptic, half-formed sentences that I typed into my phone. I may not be as efficient and overachieving as Charlene, who actually brought a notebook because she&#8217;s like 12 billion times better at blogging than I am, but I had good intentions. LOL. If you want a rational account of this weekend&#8217;s events, you may want to head over to Bookish Whimsy. Not only did Charlene <a href="http://bookishwhimsy.blogspot.com/2013/11/event-recap-vegas-valley-book-festival.html" target="_blank">recap the festival</a> RIGHT AWAY LIKE A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY, she also managed to not say &#8220;EEK!&#8221; and &#8220;SQUEE&#8221; nearly as often as I did. This is why I want to be her when I grow up. Ah, and she&#8217;s giving away some signed bookmarks and other assorted swag via Twitter this week, so go follow her asap!! Go go go!!</p>
<div id="attachment_4142" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001.png"><img class=" wp-image-4142 " alt="VVBF_001" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_001-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene and I with Alexandra Bracken! We are not freaking out in this picture! Aren&#8217;t you proud??</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The last panel was called Resurrecting the Future, and it was both the final panel of the YA portion of the festival and the last one we attended. The day was winding down, I had a mango smoothie from one of the food trucks over yonder, and life was good. It was even better because Alexandra Bracken was in this panel and we both were so excited to see/meet her at the festival! Did I mention that we spotted Alexandra walking around earlier that afternoon and got to meet her mom??? Who is the sweetest lady ever?? (Did we dream that encounter??? Hahahaha)</p>
<div id="attachment_4152" style="width: 240px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009.png"><img class=" wp-image-4152" alt="VVBF_009" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_009-682x1024.png" width="230" height="345" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charlene with Mary Lindsey! One of the sweetest authors we&#8217;ve ever met!</p></div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, there were other great authors on this panel, including Chris Howard and Lydia Kang. I am mentioning these two in particular right now because we discovered crazy amazing things about them at this panel. First off, Charlene and I spent the ENTIRE time being mesmerized by Chris Howard&#8217;s British accent &#8212; WE HAVE NO REGRETS. Second, Lydia Kang talked about the unique function of her blog, where she sets us straight about medical situations we might encounter while writing, such as how long a character can be stuck in the ICU. This is because she is way more accomplished than I am and is a doctor as well as an author. HELP??</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For fans of <em>The Darkest Minds</em> series (like us!!!), here&#8217;s a fun fact Alexandra Bracken shared at the panel: the route that Ruby and co travel through in the books is reminiscent of the Civil War trail she and her siblings followed with their dad during a college vacation. And Liam, btw, is very much like the sweet southern boys she went to college with in Virginia. Pssst&#8230; did you know she wrote her very first book (Brightly Woven) at the age of nineteen?? Again, I am not very accomplished hahahaha /cries</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the last panel we went right to book signings! I am now going to spam you with more photos, just because I can. A huge thank you all over again to all these authors!!! I loved meeting every single one. It&#8217;s such an unbelievable experience when you love a book and then get to meet the person who brought all that awesome into your life with their words and characters. Is there anything better?? No. Well, aside from cake or something. And maybe this photo of me with Stacey Jay. *points*</p>
<div id="attachment_4141" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png"><img class=" wp-image-4141 " alt="VVBF_005_640" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_005_640.png" width="640" height="427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Stacey Jay is my spirit animal. She decided to be a puma, specifically. I think it suits her perfectly. Also, I LOVE HER SO MUCH KSDHFKJSDF.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4144" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003.png"><img class=" wp-image-4144" alt="VVBF_003" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_003-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Michelle Gagnon actually made my day (and okay, my entire life) by recognizing me from the Dark Days Tour and Charlene from an event in LA! She came up to us and was like, OH IT&#8217;S YOU GUYS!! I died. HELP.</p></div>
<div id="attachment_4145" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004.png"><img class=" wp-image-4145 " alt="VVBF_004" src="http://novelideareviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/VVBF_004-1024x682.png" width="590" height="392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Let&#8217;s play &#8220;Find Your Favorite Author!!!&#8221;</p></div>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Okay, that&#8217;s it for me tonight! Um, cause I need to go back to writing. But I love you all! I hope you enjoyed the recap! If I left out any details that you need in order to live vicariously through me, let me know. I&#8217;ll happily oblige ~ Also, I hope you&#8217;re enjoying hanging out with Alix all month!!! I happen to love her.</h3>
<h3>Thank you so much to all the sponsors and organizers of the <a href="http://vegasvalleybookfestival.org/" target="_blank">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year! We had a BLAST! (Um but for 2014 could you fly in Melina Marchetta so I can die happy???)</h3>
