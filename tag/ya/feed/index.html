<h3><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Michelle Gagnon</h3>
<h3><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Science Fiction</h3>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: 2012, Harper Collins</h3>
<h3><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Paperback, 336 pages</h3>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;">When Noa Torson wakes up lying on a table with stitches in her chest and an IV in her arm, it&#8217;s even more terrifying to realize that she has no memory of how she got there. She narrowly escapes the strange warehouse with her life, but this is only the beginning of a conspiracy that Noa must unravel at the risk of becoming a victim herself. What follows is a desperate race to uncover the truth. Noa will need every skill she has in order to survive and find out what really happened to her, as well as the help of fellow hacker Peter Gregory, the only other person who seems to be on her side.</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was extremely easy to get into and a quick, suspenseful read for me. There&#8217;s never a dull moment. Noa is on the run, struggling to stay one step ahead of her pursuers while trying to find answers at the same time. I really liked the pacing; it kept me turning the pages, burning with the need to find answers myself. I mean, I know Noa had a personal investment in this because she was the one they kidnapped and subsequently cut open, but I wanted to know why too because 1) creepy and 2) REALLY creepy. Not to mention the strange side effects she starts to experience&#8230; You better believe I had some crazy theories brewing in my head while reading. Uhh, you DEFINITELY don&#8217;t want to hear any of them either. I am not exaggerating the crazy. LOL.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-4182"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that Noa was a character who&#8217;d been through a lot, from a childhood spent being utterly failed by the foster care system to recent years living off the grid on her own. She&#8217;s got street smarts and an incredible will to survive. I loved that she was such a quick thinker, because I&#8217;m a huge fan of resourceful heroines who work with what they&#8217;ve got to accomplish whatever it is they&#8217;re trying to do. She was often on the losing end of the spectrum here, with such a huge enemy to evade, but Noa did everything she could think of to stay one step ahead. But as tough as she is, perhaps the best thing about her is that she is also a very vulnerable person inside. There are quiet moments between chases and epic escapes when this side of her is revealed. She&#8217;s a believable character, I think. In a situation like this, it would be insane to not be afraid or be at a loss sometimes. She does waver, and she does get scared. What matters is that she never lets it stop her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As disconnected as Noa has been from others her own age, and from people in general, you can expect a certain amount of social awkwardness to happen. She does have a hard time relying on others, especially Peter, who comes from this entirely different background and couldn&#8217;t even begin to imagine all the things she&#8217;s been through at such a young age. He grew up with the certainty of a roof over his head and assurance that his next meal wouldn&#8217;t need to be scavenged for. Throughout the story, Peter marvels at Noa&#8217;s resilience all the time. He&#8217;s just genuinely floored by how she handles things and readily admits that he&#8217;s a long way from being anywhere near on par. But I didn&#8217;t think of Peter as a weak character&#8230; actually, I felt that he was a pretty complicated person and I think also very well-realized. He doesn&#8217;t fall into all the stereotypes he could be categorized under. He always comes through in a pinch. And you know, I liked that he was a geek.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I liked all the assorted geekery in this book. It&#8217;s great for fellow nerds out there. At the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days tour</a>, the author talked about her experience writing it and how she actually consulted a real hacker to make sure that all the computer lingo and hacking action in <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> was authentic. Peter and Noa are both pretty accomplished hackers. I was worried this aspect would be super difficult to believe, but in the end I think it was handled well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to express all over again how awesome it was to meet author Michelle Gagnon &#8212; like I said, I heard her speak at the <a title="Dark Days Tour Recap" href="http://novelideareviews.com/dark-days-tour-recap/">Dark Days panel</a> when it was here in Vegas, but I didn&#8217;t grab a copy of <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> until I ran into her again at <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Vegas Valley Book Festival</a> this year. While I was listening to her chat about her books and the process of writing them, I decided that seeing her twice in one year had to be fate or something. Not that I wasn&#8217;t already interested in reading, but this pretty much made up my mind that I was going to get a copy immediately, ask her to sign it, and finally find out why Noa woke up with an incision in her chest and no idea how or why. The mystery!!! I HAD TO KNOW. That, and Michelle is one of the nicest people in the universe. She even remembered me from the Dark Days tour even though I didn&#8217;t get a chance to talk to her then. *sobs* <a title="Recap: Vegas Valley Book Festival 2013" href="http://novelideareviews.com/recap-vegas-valley-book-festival-2013/">Read this</a> for more on that experience + a picture of me with the author. I am NOT freaking out in the picture and you should be proud. Ahem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I did end up feeling a bit put off by Peter&#8217;s immediate interest in Noa. I could&#8217;ve done without it. I mean, I&#8217;m really glad that nothing actually happens between them in this book because it would&#8217;ve been really out of character for Noa to suddenly be okay with trusting someone in that way. But I&#8217;m afraid there&#8217;s a love triangle waiting for me in the second book and I&#8217;m already covering my eyes and screaming, hahaha. Also, when the truth about what happened to her was revealed, I think maybe I was a little bit deflated because I was expecting something more. (LIKE ALL MY RIDICULOUS IDEAS MAYBE??) Of course, it&#8217;s only the first book in the series, and I am definitely sticking around to find out what else happens.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.888/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, okay, I&#8217;m giving this book one of my bizarre 3.888 ratings. WHATEVER. GET OVER IT. This is the most accurate way for me to express how I feel. LOL. I do recommend <em>Don&#8217;t Turn Around</em> if you&#8217;re looking for a suspenseful read with lots of computer geekery (not gonna lie, I totally understood all the <em>World of Warcraft</em> references&#8230; err&#8230;) and characters you can believe in. I actually already have book two, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17332508-don-t-look-now" target="_blank"><em>Don&#8217;t Look Now</em></a>, and I&#8217;m excited to find out what happens next! Except I am maybe a wee bit sad that none of my crazy theories worked out in the end&#8230; hahahaha</p>

</a></em></p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Strohmeyer</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p><strong>PUBLISHED</strong>: April 23rd 2013, Balzer + Bray;Â eBook, 320 pages</p>
<blockquote><p>Zoe learns there is a dark core under the glittering faÃ§ade of the fairy-tale themed amusement park (cough, Disneyland, cough) where sheâs a summer intern. For starters, her boss has a blacker heart than Snow Whiteâs stepmother, and the other interns are worse backstabbers than Cinderellaâs step-sisters. On the upside, she has the chance of romance with a real-life Prince Charming, and a shot at winning a big heap of cash. If she can just live through a summer in the Fairyland Kingdom. (taken from GoodReads)</p></blockquote>
<p>This book was so much fun to read! IÂ <em>reallyÂ enjoyed it! Zoe is a wonderful lead character. </em>She&#8217;s driven, caring and the best friend you could ask for. One of things I enjoy the most aboutÂ Strohmeyer is how good she is a putting friendship at the core of her stories (and not just romantic entanglements). In this case, the heart of the story lies in Zoe desperately wanting her best friend and cousin Jess to win the grant giving to be best performer at the end of the summer internship. Speaking of which, did I mention what the internship is?Â Working as fairy tale characters is a pseudo Disneyland theme park!Â How can you notÂ love the setting? The usual setting is the perfect background to the hijinks and I liked Zoe does not the absurdity of her situation.<em><br />
<span id="more-2971"></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Did I also mention that there isn&#8217;t a love triangle?Â <em>I know!Â </em>Sure Zoe has a crush on one guy, then ends up kissing another and will trying to figure out who the mysterious Prince Charming (literally Prince Charming since it&#8217;s one of the characters played by the guys as part of their internship!) saved her life and bantered with her. So refreshing! It made total sense to me that Zoe would like different guys and think about how hot they are, cause she&#8217;s a teenager! What was nice though was that it was never taken the point where she full on liked/wanted to be with more then one of the guys (a common pitfall in YA). Ultimately the romance that does emerge in the story was very sweet and real. Zoe and her mystery guy fall for each other in a normal, teenage way. I loved their dynamic together. It really was a very well done YA romance.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would say that the weak point of the story lies in the secondary characters. The Evil Queen (again literally who she is because of everyone being a storybook character) who runs the Fairytale Land was a bit too much of Â clichÃ©. They tried to give her some dimension by the end but it was too little, too late. That being said, her attitude and the antics her request lead to Zoe experiencing were quite funny. I also found that the characters who weren&#8217;t Zoe, Jess, Ian were also very clichÃ©d. I also found that every was resolved a little too well? But! I didn&#8217;t see it coming, which was really nice. Overall, these small points didn&#8217;t diminish my overall enjoyment of the story!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p>The witty humour, the easy writing style, the constantly moving story and great lead characters madeÂ <em>How Zoe Made Her Dreams (Mostly) Come True</em> a delightful read!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Sarah Dessen</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>GENRE</strong>: YA Contemporary</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Hardcover, 376 Pages (2004)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pursuit of perfection is something Macy knows by heart. She strives to be the perfect student, the perfect girlfriend, the perfect daughter, to the point that she can barely remember who the real girl is underneath. Deep inside, the real Macy is weighted with guilt and regret, still grieving in the wake of her father&#8217;s death and feeling disconnected from everyone and everything. But this is the summer when Macy will learn to let go &#8212; to be her true self, and to live fearlessly, despite how unpredictable and imperfect life can be.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So! This was my first ever Sarah Dessen book, recommended to me by the lovely Ana at <a href="http://t.co/cQarM2mD3s" target="_blank"><em>Anahera Reads</em></a> when I was looking around for a good YA Contemporary for this event. I have to admit that I&#8217;ve been hesitant to try this author&#8217;s books for YEARS. I came in half expecting something insubstantial and/or hormonal to the extreme, but my perceptions were completely changed by the time I turned the last page. Well, long before that, actually. The fact that I loved this book so much is kind of crazy, because I am definitely not a big contemporary reader, and definitely not in the YA genre. I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I find it hard to enjoy contemporary books because they just don&#8217;t seem like enough of an escape for me, but I am now making an exception for Sarah Dessen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8230; Actually, this book kind of sent me on a crazy Dessen binge. I HAVE NO REGRETS. <em>The Truth About Forever</em> surprised me with its candid look at grief, the vibrance and believability of its characters, and the small, poignant moments that I still haven&#8217;t forgotten even weeks after reading it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2243"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I love this book for its realistic take on what being a teenager is like. Since I read a lot of YA, the average age range is anywhere between 15-19 years old, and not every book has a believable take on being that age. Maybe my own experience with being in high school was the most grossly unexciting thing ever, but sometimes I run into teenaged characters who do things or live these lifestyles that seem so farfetched. Macy, however, is someone you can easily accept as being 17 years old, in that final summer before senior year and dealing with issues that are both relevant and understandable. Grief is such a powerful force, and it has shaped the way she&#8217;s been living her life. She was a character I sympathized with, but also a character I wanted to hug REALLY HARD. I liked her immediately. And I was thrilled to see that the teenagers in this book weren&#8217;t living this constant dramafest 24/7, with hookups and breakups and some new *disaster* every 5 minutes. They were just ordinary people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In fact, I think it would be pretty accurate to say that it&#8217;s the art of finding meaning in the ordinary and the everyday that makes Sarah Dessen&#8217;s writing so easy to enjoy and identify with. I&#8217;m figuring that out with every Dessen book I read. Her stories are warm and inviting, but not superficial in any way. And the thing is, even though reading this book was a lot like watching a feel-good movie, and even though some things were predictable in the way feel-good movies usually are, I didn&#8217;t care. I liked it anyway. It was comforting, a lot like sitting down at Starbucks with an old friend and just talking for hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, Wes. I <em>loved</em> Wes. I loved the entire cast, really. Minus Jason, but you aren&#8217;t really supposed to love him, and I mostly felt sorry for the guy. The book is full of people you can&#8217;t help liking. They&#8217;re funny, memorable, and have really distinct personalities. Their interactions and relationships with one another were so natural. The writer has a gift for creating characters you could easily picture living next door, waving to you from their driveway, and she even makes you wish you could really wave back.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Truth About Forever</em> is the story of one summer, with all its small joys and sorrows. It&#8217;s the little things that all add up to a bigger picture, for Macy and for the reader. It made me smile, but it also made me think, and because of that I decided I was okay with the story being a bit predictable. After all, there&#8217;s something about knowing exactly where you&#8217;re going and how to get there, and sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have a book hold your hand and make you feel like you&#8217;re home. I highly recommend it, and Sarah Dessen in general, whether you&#8217;re a big fan of contemporary or a stranger to it like I was.</p>

Josh Bennettâs story is no secret: every person he loves has been taken from his life until, at seventeen years old, there is no one left. Now all he wants is be left alone and people allow it because when your name is synonymous with death, everyone tends to give you your space.</p>
<p>Everyone except Nastya, the mysterious new girl at school who starts showing up and wonât go away until sheâs insinuated herself into every aspect of his life. But the more he gets to know her, the more of an enigma she becomes. As their relationship intensifies and the unanswered questions begin to pile up, he starts to wonder if he will ever learn the secrets sheâs been hidingâor if he even wants to. (<a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16151178-the-sea-of-tranquility" target="_blank">from Goodreads</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is aÂ beautiful, heartbreaking, gut wrenching, haunting, dark and hopeful novel. I finished it about a week ago (after reading it in one sitting!), and the emotions it caused in me still feel fresh and truthfully I am still processing them. Can you tell I loved it? Because I think saying I loved this book is an understatement.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya Kashinkov is a strong but broken teenager. Hoping to escape her past, she moves in with her aunt and starts at a new school. But she isn&#8217;t the daughter and niece her family remembers: she&#8217;s hasn&#8217;t spoken in over a year and dresses as inÂ provocativeÂ manner (she calls it her &#8220;russian whore&#8221; look). Right from the novels start, we&#8217;re made aware that something horrific has happened to Nastya, she was a piano prodigy but is no longer, she has died and been brought back to life (but not to who she was). Nastya story&#8217;s isÂ purposelyÂ revealed in a slow manner and in works. I&#8217;m not usually a fan of slow reveals but in this case, it was done so well and in a natural manner that is really worked for me. The story is told from the POV of Nastya and Josh, something that works incredibly well here. I really enjoyed getting each character&#8217;s perspective and in the case of Nastya, it showed the duality of just how strong she is while also being deeply affected by the past events.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span id="more-2274"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nastya as a character is depressing but also amazing. She clearly suffering from the result of a traumatic event: she chooses not to speak, to beÂ invisibleÂ yet also puts herself out there in aÂ confrontationalÂ manner with how she dresses. She could have easily become the clichÃ©d emo character but she isn&#8217;t at all. Her innerÂ monologueÂ gives you the insight into how she doesn&#8217;t want to be this person yet doesn&#8217;t know how to be who she was. She doesn&#8217;t want to hurt people and yet she feels like she always is. Â She feels like she can&#8217;t be saved and yet you know that she wants to be. I felt her pain, even before the revelation of what happened to her was done (in aÂ trulyÂ hard to read in that fantastic kind of way). There were times when I wanted to shake her and make her do things differently, but it was in that way you want to do when you care about someone.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Josh Bennett, the other lead of the story and Nastya&#8217;s love interest, is an equally broken character, albeit in a different. Everyone is Josh&#8217;s life has left him and now he just wants to shut down and be invisible. But that changes with the arrival of Nastya. The dynamic between Josh and Nastya is captivating. The give and take, push and pull, had me turning page after page. I just couldn&#8217;t get enough of them. And this went beyond just them falling for each other. Their romance is perfect in that imperfect kind of way but what I loved the most was that at the core of their relationship was an understanding of each other&#8217;s pain that one else could. Josh doesn&#8217;t save Nastya and Nastya doesn&#8217;t save Josh but rather Â knowing each other brings them to a place where they want to change and heal their pain.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">TheÂ surroundingÂ cast are also wellÂ developedÂ and interesting. I loved the dynamic between Nastya and Josh&#8217;s best friend Drew. Their own relationship and Drew&#8217;s character are both given the time and importance to beÂ developedÂ and explored. None of the characters in the story felt like throwaway orÂ place-fillers.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I&#8217;ll say it again, the story is beautifully written. It is a time a very dark novel, the hinted to events thatÂ occurredÂ to Nastya are disturbing and they way her post-traumatic stress manifest itself is hard to read at time. But the magic ofÂ <em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is that this is so well done that youÂ sympathizeÂ and cheer for the characters. The pitfalls of the &#8220;emo&#8221; broken girl are pretty much avoided. The writing is by far some of the best I&#8217;ve read (and not just in the YA genre).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Both these characters are damaged people, you understand why they turn away from the world the way they do and yet with each other, they find the hope needed to break free of the darkness. It&#8217;s truly beautiful story telling.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 5/5</h2>
<p><em>The Sea of Tranquility</em> is amazing story telling that affects you to your core. Nastya and Josh are wonderful, real characters. I cannot praise this book enough! Definitely pick up a copy of it if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
<p>A huge thank you toÂ Atria Books for making this book available for review via NetGalley.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: E.L. Adams</p>
<p><strong>GENRE</strong>: Middle Grade/YA Fantasy</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: Digital ARC courtesy of the author &amp; Rowanvale Books</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lexa has a problem. Okay, several problems. First of all, their cat can apparently talk. Second, she and her sister Lucinda just discovered an invisibility potion in their Uncle Devon&#8217;s storeroom. And third, Lucinda just used it &#8212; never mind the fact that it makes no sense for Uncle Devon to even have an invisibility potion. Now Lexa and her best friend Marlon must follow Lucinda into an entirely different world, one that exists side by side with their own reality, before she&#8217;s beyond their help. They will have to contend with strange magic and deadly illusions, along with the denizens of this alternate world: capricious Fey, a shapeshifting chimera, and a malicious sorcerer who calls himself the Puppeteer. Will they ever find Lucinda and make it back safely?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was lucky enough to get to know the author, <a href="http://emmaladams.weebly.com/" target="_blank">E.L. Adams</a>, as part of the <a href="http://nuzsaysitwithbooks.blogspot.com/2013/04/indie-self-published-author-event-june.html" target="_blank">Indie Self-Pub Author Event</a> hosted at <a href="http://nuzsaysitwithbooks.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Say It With Books</a> this month, which focuses on spotlighting all the great authors out there who chose an alternative to the traditional publishing route. Come back tomorrow for my interview with her tomorrow!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I had a lot of fun reading this book. It&#8217;s a great fantasy for the middle grade/younger YA audience, with plenty of humor and a dash of the eerie. I loved Lexa and Marlon&#8217;s friendship and the otherworld they ventured into, which was an interesting mix of classic fantasy elements and unique magic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-2123"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>The Puppet Spell</em> takes place mostly in another world, and I enjoyed discovering it along with Lexa and Marlon. There were a lot of contrasts between what you might expect in a fantasy world &#8212; rural villages, magical forests, odd creatures &#8212; and recognizable things like cars and cities powered by magic. There are entire kingdoms built out of illusions, which was a concept I found really interesting. Loved the detailed construction of the world and the way it was linked to our own.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was really drawn to Lexa&#8217;s inner conflict regarding her sister &#8212; I think I&#8217;ve mentioned before that books dealing with relationships between sisters are always very interesting to me because I have a sister of my own. In Lexa&#8217;s case, she has a pretty strained relationship with Lucinda, who seems to get it all without doing any work whatsoever. Lucinda is popular, makes friends as easily as breathing, and is always the center of attention. As the quieter, more subdued and generally well-behaved twin, Lexa is left out of the spotlight frequently. I completely understood her when she wondered if it wouldn&#8217;t be better to just stop chasing Lucinda. After all, wasn&#8217;t it her idea to go gallivanting off into a dangerous parallel world without a care for the trouble she might get into when she got there? I appreciated the exploration of Lexa&#8217;s insecurities and how it felt when Lucinda seemed to fit so easily into this alternate universe while Lexa, of course, was struggling with it. It was a realistic portrayal of a relationship between two siblings who are extremely different in personality and temperament.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think one thing that really shines in this book is Lexa&#8217;s friendship with Marlon. They bond over video games and commiserating over Lucinda&#8217;s latest antics, and they make each other (and the reader) laugh quite a bit throughout the story. Actually, Marlon became one of my favorite characters. I liked that he not only balanced Lexa&#8217;s personality, but also drew her out of her shell and encouraged her to stop comparing herself to Lucinda, drawing out who she was as an individual. For a middle grade audience, that kind of mutually beneficial friendship is such an important message.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would recommend <em>The Puppet Spell</em> to anyone fond of venturing into other worlds, where magic still exists and cats can turn into chimeras. It has a real <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> feel to it at times while still maintaining its own unique atmosphere. Thank you so much to <a href="http://emmaladams.weebly.com/" target="_blank">the author</a> and Rowanvale Books for the review copy &#8212; I am especially thankful to E.L. Adams for interviewing with me!

<p><strong>SERIES:</strong> <em>Caster Chronicles</em>, #2</p>
<p><strong>AUTHORS</strong>: Kami Garcia &amp; Margaret Stohl</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT:</strong> eBook, 284 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lena&#8217;s sixteenth birthday is over, and the impending disaster averted for the time being, but it doesn&#8217;t mean Ethan Wate can rest easy. It&#8217;s impossible to be a normal teenager or maintain a normal relationship when your girlfriend is possessed of otherworldly powers, after all. Otherworldly powers that have the potential to upset the balance between casters and humans, otherworldly powers that Lena can&#8217;t always control. But what&#8217;s more terrifying is when she does control it, and when she chooses to do things the old Lena never would have even considered. Ethan finds himself helpless in the wake of Lena&#8217;s grief as they are both swept up in the aftermath of what happened the night she turned sixteen. There will always be a space between them that they can&#8217;t bridge; Lena Duchannes is a caster, while Ethan is not. Just being together is going to be a battle for them, forever. But in the second installment of the series, that space between them becomes a rift, and Lena seems to be pulling further and further away. What results in an exploration of what-ifs: what if they weren&#8217;t together anymore? What if they accepted that they might never be?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was worried about encountering the dreaded Second Book Blahs with this next chapter of their story, but my worries were unfounded. <em>Beautiful Darkness</em> takes what happened in the first book and pushes it deeper into the shadows, testing faith and challenging the limits of what Ethan and Lena would do to stay together against the odds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-906"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Yes, Please:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In <a title="Beautiful Creatures" href="http://briar-rose.net/books/beautiful-creatures/" target="_blank">my review of the first book</a> in this series, I noted that Ethan and Lena are a refreshing addition to the roster of YA couples out there. But I didn&#8217;t realize <em>how</em> refreshing until I started another series recently and found myself missing them with an intensity I never expected of myself. Guys, Ethan and Lena are great. They&#8217;re different because they&#8217;re realistic. Ethan is devoted to Lena, sure, but he&#8217;s devoted in a way that is appropriate for his age and makes sense when you think about everything that&#8217;s happened to them. I may be a wee bit biased because I actually really love Ethan &#8212; I have this major soft spot for him as a narrator and as a character that I won&#8217;t ever deny &#8212; but I truly think that this pairing is special. They have problems, problems they&#8217;re forced to face. In fact, they spend 3/4 of this book apart. Their relationship is really put to the test, and not entirely by outside forces. It&#8217;s Lena who begins to pull away and continues to do so. As much as Lena went overboard with the whole brooding thing in this installment, I can&#8217;t help but admire her determination to figure out who she really is on her own, and not just based on being with Ethan, or relying on what others want her to be. This is her primary conflict, and I respect it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And we have to talk about the Love Quadrangle, because this kind of blew my mind. The entire time I sensed that it was brewing, waiting on the horizon about to pounce on me, I still couldn&#8217;t completely believe that they&#8217;d go there. Oh, but they did. They Love Quadrangled this thing like crazy. Again, refreshing! Oh, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. &#8220;Paola, you just think Love Quadrangles are refreshing because we all know you despise Love Triangles. A different shape doesn&#8217;t make the plot device any better or worse!&#8221; But wait &#8212; yes it does. I think it especially affects this dynamic in particular because Lena and Ethan are both caught in the crossfire between two worlds that are separate and different. They react to those worlds differently. Lena longs to find her place in the caster world she was born into, but can&#8217;t break free from an innate desire to fit in among the humans who have ostracized her. Meanwhile, Ethan wants nothing more than to run away from the human world he belongs in, and yet can&#8217;t quite reconcile himself to the caster side of things. Enter a caster boy and a human girl to form the two other corners of this quadrangle and you get a really interesting set of problems. Ethan and Lena become more believable as characters because they have really believable motivations and wishes. Lena wants to be understood, to be free to be herself. That&#8217;s why she finds herself drawn to someone who makes that easier. Ethan loves Lena and accepts her, and yet can&#8217;t deny the pull of being with someone who isn&#8217;t as complicated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that the Love Quadrangle happened. I like that, at the end of the book, the authors didn&#8217;t try to pretend like it never did. Ethan and Lena&#8217;s relationship changes because of it. There are emotional scars now where there were none before. Their feelings for one another were strained almost to the breaking point. I liked that the authors dared to go there, and that they didn&#8217;t try to ditch the consequences afterward.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, I just really have to say that I love Link and Ridley, both together and separate. I just do. Almost as much as Ethan and Lena.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not So Much:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are occasionally some things about the Caster universe that flat out baffle and confuse me. Or, if not that, then they strike me as really bizarre/unbelievable in a fantasy context. It&#8217;s kind of hard to juggle so many different types of casters and remember what all their powers are, and Lena&#8217;s relatives just keep coming out of the woodwork. There are a lot of coincidental things that take place and we all know that such coincidences tend to annoy me. They&#8217;re just too&#8230;convenient. I&#8217;m still waiting for the Big Villain to appear, because if it remains the same person/set of people throughout the whole series then I&#8217;m going to be kind of disappointed. Also, does Amma have any limits at all? Because she is always there to bail them out of whatever is happening, and I kinda wish she wouldn&#8217;t be there once in a while. That might be interesting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I may be alone in this, but the implications linked to Lena&#8217;s choice of Light or Dark are still really muddy for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">***SPOILERS BELOW***<br />
HIGHLIGHT TO VIEW<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">This is a spoiler, but I didn&#8217;t like that Sarafine was able to strip Ridley of her powers all in one fell swoop. That seems like overkill. No singular caster should be able to take another&#8217;s powers, no matter what kind of shit is going down. It tips the balance too far. Also, why couldn&#8217;t Macon stay dead??? It&#8217;s not that I dislike him, I just wanted to see Lena get over her grief and become stronger instead of having the whole problem solved by reversing what caused the grief in the first place.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3.5/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a solid second installment and definitely didn&#8217;t suffer from Second Book Syndrome. If anything, it only made me more interested in discovering Gatlin&#8217;s other secrets and more invested in Ethan and Lena as characters. While not without its minor issues, <em>Beautiful Darkness</em> delivered and accomplished what it was supposed to do. (AND there was a Love Quadrangle.)</p>

<p><strong>SERIES:</strong> <em>Unearthly</em>, #1</p>
<p><strong>AUTHOR:</strong> Cynthia Hand</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 453 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It begins with a vision: burning trees, a boy standing on the edge of the inferno. Clara Gardner, who found out not long ago that she is something more than human, is having her first glimpse of what lies ahead for her. She&#8217;s part angel, and all angels are placed on earth for a reason. That reason is revealed to them through visions like this one. Clara&#8217;s waking dreams are sudden and impossible to predict; they can happen in the middle of the night, or in the middle of a history presentation. She sees what fate has in store for her in cryptic, incredibly sensory fragments, the pieces of a puzzle she must put together in order to achieve what she is destined for. And because this purpose is the crux of her entire existence on this planet, it warrants uprooting the entire family from California to Wyoming in order to ensure that Clara fulfills what is required of her. This means a new home, a new school, and a new set of complications. As the clues fall into place, it becomes clear that her purpose is fairly straightforward: save the boy in the burning forest. But the path to that resolution is far from simple, and Clara is forced to choose between love and duty, fate and choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes, I realize I&#8217;m arriving (fashionably? unfashionably?) late to the whole <em>Unearthly</em> series, but you have to understand that I&#8217;m usually pretty wary of anything in the &#8216;paranormal romance&#8217; category. The odds are always high that there&#8217;s going to be a love triangle, and if you&#8217;ve been reading my reviews then you should know that I&#8217;ve become rather bored of that particular plot device. There is a love triangle in this series, of course, but I decided to be brave and plunge in anyway. And while I can&#8217;t say I was blown out of the water, I will say that this book held my attention far longer and far better than I expected it to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-901"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Yes, Please:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The book&#8217;s take on angels is interesting, and certainly different. I liked that angels have a purpose &#8212; they might be here as messengers, or as guardians. It was intriguing that the purpose wasn&#8217;t instantly revealed to them, but rather gradually pieced together over time. In the end, the question shifts from, &#8220;What is Clara&#8217;s purpose?&#8221; to &#8220;Will her purpose dictate her entire life?&#8221; Because the ultimate question in Unearthly is whether or not Clara is free to decide what path to take. She is on earth to fulfill a divine purpose, after all. Is there nothing more to her existence than this? Christian, the boy she sees in her visions, becomes a metaphor for Clara&#8217;s duty. Tucker, the boy who wins her heart, becomes a metaphor for the fact that Clara is half human &#8212; the part of her that isn&#8217;t an angel, isn&#8217;t otherworldly at all, is drawn to the possibility of a normal life. Everything outside her purpose is a distraction along the way to meeting her destiny. But is that destiny her only choice? The visions are sometimes blurred, sometimes inconsistent; certain details change. Clara sees the different threads of her future, intertwining and tangling, but there is no concrete way that this future could play out. It adds more dimension to the idea of angels having a purpose. How can they really be sure what that purpose is?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I enjoyed Tucker as a character. He defied my expectations of him and became someone I could genuinely like. I thought he was probably the most well-drawn of the supporting characters in the story; actually, I had a better sense of Tucker than I did of Clara (more on her later), and I definitely connected more with him than I did with Christian. I&#8217;m thinking we&#8217;ll be delving more into the Christian side of things in later books, so that isn&#8217;t a complaint or anything. Just an observation that Book 1 was very much dominated by Tucker. I&#8217;m not sorry about that because, like I said, he&#8217;s a great character. He&#8217;s a well-loved figure in the story, but I think that he would probably be just as well-loved if he were a real person &#8212; something that isn&#8217;t always true of other popular characters in books.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of Tucker, we have to discuss the love triangle. It really wasn&#8217;t that bad. And this is coming from someone who loathes love triangles with a passion. Yes, lots of mushiness and other such goings on, but I liked the fact that the choice between the two guys really was a terrible choice to have to make. Neither of them was a jerk. And the choice between Tucker and Christian came down to more than just who asked Clara to prom first. She really does need to choose, and in the end, she makes that choice. I appreciated this.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not So Much:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Um, Clara. Clara, not so much. She is so super generic in every way. There is literally nothing unique about her except that she&#8217;s half-angel. You could probably do a couple of name swaps here and there and she would sound just like Bella from <em>Twilight</em>, mooning after Christian/Edward in the halls of her high school. This, I didn&#8217;t appreciate. The main character should carry the story, and not the other way around. And with all the tons of similar books and similar plotlines out there, you really need to make that main character stand out. I didn&#8217;t really care what happened to Clara, I cared more about the people around her. She&#8217;s got all the things you would expect from the heroine of a YA paranormal romance: plenty of awkward moments, the challenge of starting at a new school, mommy issues, daddy issues, a sibling she bickers with, a crush on an unattainable boy, a best friend who fades into the background, another best friend who does the complete opposite, and a massive secret that no one must ever know about OR ELSE. It&#8217;s so blah. SHE is so blah. That was a problem for me because I prefer a strong female lead who doesn&#8217;t spend all her time dithering over whether or not she should ask that unattainable boy to sit next to her at lunch time. Snooooooze.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As interesting as the author&#8217;s take on angels might be, there are also a bunch of things I just couldn&#8217;t reconcile with. The biggest problem I had was the idea that angels need to think happy thoughts in order to fly. What? That&#8217;s stupid. They have wings. Their use of those wings should be intuitive. They shouldn&#8217;t need to be happy in order to make the wings work. I mean, seriously?? Fine, they can hide them at will, that seems like a reasonable thing an angel would be able to do. I can accept that. Some birds evolved different beaks depending on their food source, some moths evolved darker wings to blend in with increasingly sooty, polluted conditions in the wild. Angels could evolve to be able to hide their wings and not draw attention to themselves. But why the hell would angels need to think happy thoughts in order to remain airborne?? WINGS should help them stay airborne. Wings and lots of practice learning how to fly. I just thought that concept was stupid. I also took issue with angels uttering a particular phrase in order to force other angels into revealing their wings against their will. Again: what?? All you have to do is say the magic passphrase and other angels&#8217; wings go exploding out of their backs? I call shenanigans, sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the end, I would have liked this book more if less time was spent on Clara&#8217;s innumerable high school dramas and more on the angel stuff in general. By the time I was halfway, I&#8217;d had enough of history class projects and who was sitting next to who in the cafeteria. I understand that this is a YA book and OF COURSE a YA book would cover things that its target audience would identify with, but this just went overboard with it. A little bit of it here and there, that&#8217;s totally fine. But the mundane stuff drags on and on and on. You start to wonder if anything exciting or even remotely relevant to angels is going to take place. It sometimes seemed like Clara was just going to keep having random moments spaced out and seeing visions but it was NEVER GOING TO GO ANYWHERE. I sincerely hope the rest of the series corrects this because I am still interested, just completely dreading having to sit through 200+ pages of omg guess who was standing by my locker after fifth period.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The premise has a lot of potential, and the supporting characters (if not the main character herself) are actually very genuine. They make you care about them even when Clara doesn&#8217;t pique interest. I have hope that the series improves with every book, as Clara matures and the plot unfolds. It&#8217;s more than a little formulaic at times, but there&#8217;s something shining beneath the surface that made me want to keep going.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR:</strong> Kay Honeyman</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT:</strong> Digital ARC, 339 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the Chinese zodiac, girls born under the sign of the Fire Horse are destined to be everything a girl in China shouldn&#8217;t be. Willful, stubborn, and bold, Jade Moon seems to fulfill this prediction to the letter. She has never felt like anything but a burden and a curse to her family, an outsider in the village of her birth and with slim prospects for a happy future in her homeland. So when a stranger named Sterling Promise arrives to offer her father an opportunity to immigrate to the United States, Jade Moon finds herself drawn to the possibility of a new beginning. She could be someone else in America: a girl with the freedom to break the storm clouds hanging over her head since the day she was born. This deep desire for freedom and independence sparks a connection between Jade Moon and the clever, silver-tongued Sterling Promise &#8212; a connection that is severed by betrayal. Jade Moon arrives in 1923 San Francisco and is forced to find her own path, one that will require all of her passion and will to ensure survival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I applied for an ARC of this book via <a href="http://netgalley.com" target="_blank">NetGalley</a> way back in October 2012, and didn&#8217;t think I would be receiving a copy since it released on January 1st and I hadn&#8217;t heard anything back yet. I was excited to find out that I was approved for an ARC earlier this week because I&#8217;ve been wanting to read this one very much. So, a big thank you to Scholastic for letting me read &amp; review! If you&#8217;re a fan of Lisa See and appreciate a brave, strong-willed heroine, then you&#8217;ll probably enjoy it as much as I did.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-855"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Yes, Please:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The story is well written and well paced. I appreciated that Jade Moon was such a solidly defined character; she&#8217;s brash, headstrong, and has a fiery temper to match her zodiac sign. But she has a side to her that is also very fragile. She&#8217;s a dreamer at heart, possessed of high ideals beneath her tough exterior. And what she wants is something many girls can identify with: the freedom to be herself, instead of what the world wants her to be. The book&#8217;s setting is 1920&#8242;s China and San Francisco &#8212; a time of huge conflicts in immigration laws, but also a time of enduring expectations when it came to girls and young women. Jade Moon is expected to be docile and essentially silent in her native China, and the same is required of her when she arrives in America. There seems to be no place where she can be a woman both free and independent. Forced to dress as a man in order to conceal her identity, Jade Moon ends up carving a place for herself in a man&#8217;s world. But still, she can&#8217;t shake her dream of being Jade Moon, and no one else. She holds on to who she is. I loved that about her.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Confession: while reading, I was totally bouncing around going OMG SHE&#8217;S LIKE 1920&#8242;s MULAN IT&#8217;S SO AWESOME)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(Don&#8217;t hate. As an Asian girl, you have no idea how much impact Mulan made on my life as Disney&#8217;s first Asian heroine. *cries*)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked that the book took so many twists and turns that weren&#8217;t immediately predictable. We follow Jade Moon from rural China to Angel Island, the western equivalent to Ellis Island. From there, we plunge into the dark underbelly of San Francisco&#8217;s Chinatown during the waning years of <em>tong</em> domination. The tongs at their most innocuous were simply groups of men sharing the same trade; at their worst and most dangerous, they were gangsters embroiled in illegal drug and human trafficking. I didn&#8217;t expect the book to go in this direction, and I liked learning about a point in history that I have little experience with. It&#8217;s a facet of immigration that isn&#8217;t often explored. As an immigrant myself, I could identify with Jade Moon&#8217;s wish to find a place for herself in this country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think, though, that what really won me over while reading this story was the growth in Jade Moon&#8217;s character and her extremely complicated relationship with Sterling Promise. I was thrilled to discover that there would be more between these two than just a standard cut and dry romance. You know from the beginning when they meet that there&#8217;s something there, but as the story unfolds, you start to wonder if they&#8217;ll ever be able to work anything out or if they&#8217;ll even see each other again. It may seem odd that I appreciate this uncertainty, but you have to understand that I like to be pleasantly surprised. I didn&#8217;t want something predictable for two people who were so compelling. I loved that they were so wrong for each other, and yet so very right. The author handled it brilliantly.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not So Much:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I kind of wish certain characters didn&#8217;t &#8220;coincidentally&#8221; appear everywhere Jade Moon went. I guess Chinatown is a small world though, so it would be plausible for Jade Moon to meet familiar faces at every corner. I think it might have added more depth if pivotal moments in the story didn&#8217;t have anything to do with people she&#8217;d already met, I guess this took away some of the realism for me. But it&#8217;s a minor complaint at best.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an adult, I would have been fine with exploring darker themes in this story &#8212; the book tackles some really tough topics such as prostitution, but glosses over them at best. I&#8217;m not saying I wanted more blood, sex, or violence, but I wouldn&#8217;t have been bothered if there was more because it would have added more dimension to the story for me. The dangers would have been more real and immediate rather than a lingering menace in the background.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was disappointed that Harry&#8217;s character was not explored further. True, I was extremely glad that the love triangle I thought I saw brewing on the horizon did not, in fact, happen&#8230; but there was so much I wanted to know about Harry, both during and after the story. The same goes for Neil, a character I really liked and whose past I wanted to know more about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But I guess my biggest complaint about this book isn&#8217;t even really a legitimate complaint, or any kind of criticism really &#8212; and I think that&#8217;s a good thing. What I really wanted from <em>The Fire Horse Girl</em>, once I turned the final page, was to know more. I wish I could find out what happened beyond the happy ending. And I feel like that&#8217;s a great thing to complain about when it comes to a book, to want more of the characters and their stories.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 4/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fans of Lisa See and Amy Tan will enjoy this, as well as anyone interested in the history of immigration to the U.S. The heroine is a likeable, believable strong female lead and the story is paced well. The story is well-paced and extremely readable. I recommend this one!</p>

<p><strong>SERIES</strong>: <em>Caster Chronicles</em>, Book 1</p>
<p><strong>AUTHORS</strong>: Kami Garcia &amp; Margaret Stohl</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT:</strong> eBook, 376 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Life in Gatlin is incredibly predictable. In this small Southern town, the most excitement you&#8217;ll ever get is a rousing Civil War re-enactment. Ethan Wate is just counting down the days until he can leave Gatlin for good, papering his walls with maps of faraway places and dreaming of new sights. That is, until he begins to dream about the girl. He has no idea who she is, has no idea why the dreams keep coming, but it&#8217;s only the beginning. The storm is coming, and a girl named Lena Duchannes is about to change Ethan&#8217;s life &#8212; and make him question everything he thought he knew about Gatlin &#8212; forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I picked this up after randomly seeing <a href="http://beautifulcreatures.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank">the film&#8217;s trailer</a> on TV one night. I was mildly intrigued by what looked like a fairly decent cast and a passably interesting premise, even if it did seem an awful lot like Twilight (and other such paranormal romances hopping on the bandwagon). I thought, why not give it a chance? Even so, I wasn&#8217;t expecting very much. It&#8217;s gotten harder for me to enjoy YA books. I&#8217;m 25 years old, married, and no longer living in a world where everything is overly dramatic, motivated by hormones, or revolving around senior prom. My high school days are over, so sometimes it gets really difficult to sympathize with high school-centric plots and characters. That being said, I still thought this book was a pleasant surprise. Not anything life changing for me, sure, but much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. I&#8217;m not going to say it was because I had low expectations, because I really feel like the authors got something right. It&#8217;s not a perfect read, it&#8217;s not going to shatter your perceptions of the paranormal romance trend, but it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-835"></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Yes, Please:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve read the book synopsis or seen the trailers for its upcoming film adaptation, then you probably already know that Lena Duchannes is something else entirely. She&#8217;s a Caster, specifically &#8212; someone born with powers that, at the age of sixteen, will be claimed for either the Light or the Dark. Lena&#8217;s greatest fear is to be claimed by the Dark, and this is with good reason. For generations, a curse has meant that casters of Lena&#8217;s family are essentially forced to go Dark, regardless of whether they want to or not. It&#8217;s a price they are paying for a catastrophic choice made decades ago &#8212; a choice that links Ethan with Lena, and which will determine their fate. The book&#8217;s question is, who decides your fate? Over the course of the story, Lena fights to remain in the Light, but her efforts seem to be throwing her further and further into the Dark. Will the curse claim her, or will she claim herself? I didn&#8217;t expect the story to even delve this deep, so that was nice. I do think it would&#8217;ve been awesome for them to delve into it deeper, but I like that they went there in the first place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;ve seen a lot of people complaining that Ethan isn&#8217;t a very good narrator. Some go so far as to blast the authors, both female, for attempting to capture a male adolescent point of view. It is certainly very daring for female writers to choose a male pov, in the same way it&#8217;s daring for a man to try writing from the pov of a woman. I&#8217;m always wary when this happens, in either direction. I didn&#8217;t have any issues with Ethan, though. Actually I thought he was kind of refreshing. They don&#8217;t try to make him seem like a perfect guy &#8212; they make him seem like a good guy, and that&#8217;s okay. We need more good guys in the world. Ethan&#8217;s your standard Southern gentleman. I found his voice to be believably age appropriate. He made me laugh once in a while, really laugh, and I liked that he was ordinary. This made the impact of Lena&#8217;s arrival into his humdrum existence all the more vibrant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The setting is vividly done. But I&#8217;ve always had a fascination for the antebellum south and anything mildly <em>Gone With the Wind</em>-ish, so I guess I might be biased in that sense. I thought the occult aspects of the story were crafted with care. The writing itself verges on lyrical at times, and I appreciate that. You need a little prose in there, I think. I&#8217;m not one of those people who rails against writers who use prose. There is magic mingled with history. There is wonderful use of sensory detail. Like I said, the writing was above my expectations. I cared about Ethan, Lena, and the other characters. Another thing I appreciated was the book&#8217;s exploration of grief. This appears in several aspects throughout the story, in different forms.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Not So Much:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As is my complaint with many books in the genre, it&#8217;s pretty hard to imagine two sixteen-year-olds falling in love forever and ever. This sort of steals some credibility away for me. You&#8217;re a sophomore in high school &#8212; you have no idea what you&#8217;re doing. I get that very strong feelings are possible, because I&#8217;ve been there and done that. But still, it always bothers me when I read romantic books about teenagers because I&#8217;m just not in that part of my life anymore. This is certainly nothing to fault the authors for, I mean I&#8217;m not their target audience or anything, but I do worry that it gives teenagers weird, unrealistic expectations of love. I wish Ethan and Lena had more time to decide if there was something more between them, something not determined strictly by the strange connection they had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I liked the setting, and I thought it was well done for the most part, but the Southern-ness of it all seemed kind of over the top for me. I have lived in the South myself, and even for me it seemed like it was too much. The accents, for one, were annoying. Not everyone in the South sounds like that. Southern accents are hard to portray on paper without making them look, well, contrived. I would&#8217;ve liked less of that, and less of the usual Southern cliches, although the authors should be credited with bringing in small details that made it more realistic because they were obviously very knowledgeable about the setting. I thought the ending seemed hazy, confusing, and sort of rushed. I had noooo idea what was going on there for a while. It switches briefly to Lena&#8217;s point of view, but her voice didn&#8217;t seem all that distinguishable from Ethan&#8217;s. Lena, as well, was a pretty reactive character rather than proactive, and I wanted more out of her because she has so much potential to be different, a nice change from other female leads in YA. I wanted her to be as refreshing and real as Ethan.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m giving this book credit where it&#8217;s due. For its genre, and for its target audience, it&#8217;s above the standard fare. Pick it up if you enjoy a paranormal romance with (gasp!) NO LOVE TRIANGLE! (You had to be expecting me to bring this up, right? It&#8217;s like my #1 YA pet peeve.) And give it a chance if you want to try the shallow end of Southern gothic, if you&#8217;re a Civil War enthusiast, or if you just like an easy read with a little magic, mystery, and history. I&#8217;d say you should at least read it if you&#8217;re interested in <a href="http://beautifulcreatures.warnerbros.com/" target="_blank">the upcoming movie</a>, which I think is out next month.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR</strong>: Laini Taylor</p>
<p><strong>FORMAT</strong>: eBook, 462 pages</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karou always wanted to learn the truth behind her identity. Now she does know; the mystery is solved, but the knowledge is painful to bear. Battling her own conscience and struggling with the fact that she not only betrayed her people, but was betrayed in turn, Karou becomes determined to atone for her sins. Meanwhile, Akiva forges ahead with his own fight for redemption. Once, in another world and another life, they had dreamed of a different way of living. Now, that dream seems even more impossible than ever. The sequel to <em>Daughter of Smoke and Bone</em> takes us to the Moroccan desert, to the shining spires of the seraphim capital, and into a new and even deadlier war.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span id="more-807"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s get one thing straight: I <em>love</em> Daughter of Smoke and Bone. Also, I love Laini Taylor. I read her blog often and I&#8217;m on a mission to pick up and read anything/everything she has ever written, including her short story in <a title="Foretold" href="http://briar-rose.net/books/2012/10/foretold/">Foretold</a>. I think she&#8217;s an incredible writer and I always feel like crap in comparison when I read anything of hers. Her heroine, Karou, was beguiling simply for the fact that she was so completely aware of herself and who she was. Yes, her past was a mystery, but she was Karou and she had a firm hold on that. She was comfortable in her own skin, with her own personality. She was funny, smart, creative, strong. There was a wee tiny bit of romantic in her, but not much; she was a sensible girl, a practical person, and that was okay with me. She acted like a grown up instead of an annoying teenage girl, a plus for me because I can no longer read YA the same way I did when I was seventeen. Karou was refreshing. The book itself was refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, I&#8217;d been looking forward to this sequel for months as a result of my love affair with Book 1. I wanted more of the world, more of Karou, more of Akiva. I wanted to know what happened next. But the thing is, I should&#8217;ve been prepared&#8230; because I hardly ever like the middle book in a trilogy. This is because it seems like most middle books can&#8217;t stand on their own and always end up in the shadow of the first book; they&#8217;re never as good, never as bright and shining and thrilling, somehow. There are a lot of in-between events and set ups for the finale. And this is what happened with me and Days of Blood and Starlight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I didn&#8217;t dislike it. But I wasn&#8217;t completely enthralled either, and I think that&#8217;s why I feel so sad. I wanted more out of it. I wanted Karou to keep on being Karou, only changed of course by the events of Book 1. I wanted her to be even stronger, to stay true to herself and be smart about her decisions. I wanted Akiva to forgive himself. And really, I wanted the two to forgive one another for everything that happened in the past and for everything that might happen in the future. Because there&#8217;s still enough of a hopeless romantic in me that I hope their relationship can survive somehow. I&#8217;m not saying that I would be upset if it didn&#8217;t turn out that way. I know that reality doesn&#8217;t always comply. And it would make perfect sense to me, despite my hope for them, if they never did reconcile. If the truth and all its consequences ended up being too much to bear, I would understand. Still, what annoyed me was that Karou keeps fighting the fact that she belongs with Akiva in some way. She keeps treating him like shit, and he keeps coming back to her, trying to help her. I want one of them to just stop. Either Karou stops being a bitch or Akiva stops coming back. One of you, grow a spine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, I want Zuzana to shut up. Just shut up. And stop making out with your boyfriend every 2 seconds because it is seriously disturbing and DOES NOT give me a fuzzy, happy feeling. I get that it&#8217;s a sharp contrast to Karou and Akiva being alone and separate, but still, please stop. Zuzana should not have been so prevalent in this book. Her personality needed to be toned down many, MANY notches. I can appreciate her the way she was in Book 1, in the background, a sort of tether for Karou in the human world, but I don&#8217;t like her increased involvement in this book. Her endless nattering on and on stopped being funny/amusing/charming and just became irritating after a while.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It bothered me that many characters were introduced in this book but were never mentioned in Book 1. My specific peeve is with Ziri, who I feel should have been included in the first book because apparently he was ever so present in the events of Karou&#8217;s past life. He is also poised to become a major player in the final book, not to mention as a (GAG) potential love triangle corner. Oh man, that really killed me when she started setting up this love triangle. WHY! I was so HAPPY when Daughter of Smoke and Bone had no love triangle! The love triangle is so over-used in YA. I just want to be done with it. I like Ziri as a character, sure, and I have no issues with how his part played out, but man. A love triangle, dawning on the horizon. PLEASE STOP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;d say the most character development occurred with Liraz, and I was glad about that. She is an interesting character and her point of view was a welcome change from Karou&#8217;s drudgery and guilt-fest in the desert and Akiva&#8217;s moaning and wailing about Karou. I am intrigued by the Stelians and I hope they don&#8217;t disappoint me in Book 3. I also want the old Karou back, please. And for everyone to plleeeaaassseee stop going on about how awesome and lovely and perfect Madrigal was. It seems odd and bordering on Mary Sue-ish. Also, whatever happened to Madrigal&#8217;s sister? Or did I just miss that somewhere&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, it pains me to do this but I have to rate the book with 3 stars. It was just very meh for me. I wanted more. It got considerably better in the second half of the book when it seemed like Karou was finally coming to her senses and Akiva was being less of a big whiny baby about life. I LOVE Akiva and I LOVE Karou but I was really not impressed with either of them in this installment. BUT. I am still going to read the last book. Because I still have faith in this trilogy, and I still believe that the story is unique in the YA world. (But if there is a love triangle, I will scream.)</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">RATING: 3/5</h2>
