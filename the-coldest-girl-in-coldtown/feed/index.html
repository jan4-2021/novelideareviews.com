		<description><![CDATA[I love it when a book is so good you wish there was a sequel. Crazy enough, I haven&#039;t read anything by Holly Black yet, but I really am interested in this. Even though vampires are overused, I&#039;ve been hearing good things about this one and I do love vampires when done right. Great review, Paola!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know... I was really skeptical when I picked this up because it&#039;s so rare for me to like a vampire book anymore BUT I really loved the way Holly Black pulled it off. And yes, I agree about standalone novels being eaten up by so many series these days! We definitely need to talk about that on an opinion post soon!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So happy you loved this book so much! I&#039;ve been weary of vampire because of a certain series *coughtwilightcough*, which ruined the genre for me but I think I&#039;m gonna have to add this to my TBR. I also love that it isn&#039;t part of a series, although I understand loving a book so much you want more... But I have series fatigue. What ever happened to stand alone books (hmmm future opinion post for here?)!]]></description>
