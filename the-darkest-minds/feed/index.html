		<description><![CDATA[NOOOO OMGGGG Chubs in the end... HELP!!! And before that he had this major Neville Moment when they were leaving East River and I just stood up and cheered. Seriously. So much love for this book&#039;s characters!! Go read In Time ASAP!! I started reading the first chapter of Never Fade and it&#039;s already looking good!! But I will probably be sobbing profusely again when it&#039;s over &gt;&lt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Kim! I hope you like it! That &quot;facepunch&quot; aspect is a big reason why this book was so good, in my opinion. For some reason I enjoy having my heart broken while reading &gt;&lt;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dude, this is a certified FBF (Facepunched By Feels) Book. Maybe not at Finnikin levels, but certainly up there. (Then again, are there any books out there that have FBF levels comparable to a Marchetta novel?? I THINK NOT??) Read this so we can ask for our shredded emotions back when we see Alexandra Bracken in person! :O]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Seriously, just knowing that it made you feel that way makes me want to read it so I can cry with you.&quot; 

I &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; understand this feeling!!! And there&#039;s nothing wrong with feeling that way, either! I hope you decide to pick it up in the future, definitely one that I recommend. It was so crazy because I totally called it and yet watching my prediction unfold was somehow so much more emotional than I ever imagined it would be. I love when books are like this, though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You definitely need to read it, Kelly! Highly recommended! Agreed, the books I love best are always the ones that break my heart. I really thought I had braced myself for what happened at the end of this one, but it was 10x more emotional while it was happening than when I predicted it in my head. 

Thank you!! Go read this!! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so glad you love this one Paola! It&#039;s been on my TBR list for the LONGEST time ever.
I know what you mean when you say that you were expecting it to happen and therefore you think that it won&#039;t affect you that much, only to get sucker-punched in face by feels when it actually does happen. I&#039;m so glad that The Darkest Minds can do that. I hate being emotionless while reading. :P
Awesome review Paola! :D]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh sounds like a great book!  I LOVE when a book can give me the feels.  I feel like it&#039;s even more impressive when you know that it&#039;s coming all along but you still can&#039;t stop yourself from getting emotional.  Seriously, just knowing that it made you feel that way makes me want to read it so I can cry with you.  (Sometimes I wonder if there&#039;s something wrong with me!)  Ahhhh why do I have so many books to read already?!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just love being facepunched to the feels by books. IT&#039;S SUCH A WONDERFUL FEELING, LMAO. Yes to all the feelings about Ruby and Liam, sob. I have such soft spots for both Chubs and Zu too, I was so sad when Zu did what she wanted to do with her cousin, EVEN sadder for Chub&#039;s... unfortunate ending. :( Can&#039;t wait to read Never Fade!!]]></description>
