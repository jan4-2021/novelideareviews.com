		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jessica! Nice to meet you! I agree, it is definitely nice to go back to &quot;normal&quot; and not have to keep yourself updated on all the castles and kings and court politics, etc! I always go back to fantasy in the end because it&#039;s my favorite genre, but I&#039;ve really warmed up to contemporary since last year.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really like Kasie West&#039;s dialogue -- if Pivot Point&#039;s characters have banter/conversation like this, then I think I&#039;m gonna enjoy it a lot!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a wonderful review!  I really liked The Distance Between Us, too, and I agree that the highlights are both Caymen and Xander.  And also that Xander is ADORABLE!  I love that he wasn&#039;t that stereotypical irresponsible rich guy.  He was just so easy to love.  As was Caymen with her witty remarks.  Now I want to read this again!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great review! I&quot;m the same way! I&#039;m a HUGE fan of fantasy, but I like to break it up with contemporary books. Sometimes you get so wrapped up in this amazing new world, and then it&#039;s nice to just kinda go back to &quot;normal&quot; for a book or two! I&#039;ll definitely have to check this book out!]]></description>
