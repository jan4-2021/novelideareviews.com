		<description><![CDATA[Ohhhh, I see someone has a soft spot for Finn! Haha!! You know, I do too. I love him as a character. I love Evanjalin more -- she&#039;s my spirit animal -- but even when Finn is being ridiculous I still want to hug him. He gets picked on a lot but gets better at taking it in stride, haha! And of course you always get the feeling that they pick on him with more affection than anything else. 

Can&#039;t wait for your post! If you want, you can join our Finnikin group on Goodreads so you&#039;ll have a place to talk about the series if you read the rest of the books!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Right?? I mean who would want to be on the receiving end of that Isaboe glare??? NOT ME. Also she might throw a fleece out the window at me. But then I&#039;d know she was doing it out of love so I&#039;d be okay with that ;D (I JUST LOVE HER SO MUCH HELP ME)

You know, I&#039;m kinda in the middle... like I totally understood what Finn was talking about but I also understood why Evanjalin was so set on getting back to Lumatere because she, like me, has this really strong sense of justice and it was pure JUSTICE to be able to go back to their home and kick out the people who&#039;d slaughtered her family. She had that extra level of motivation. In the end, I was so happy when they DID get Lumatere back.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Charlene. At first I thought that Finnikin was right. It seemed like a lot of pain and suffering to put their people through to try and get them back into a cursed land that might not even be what it used to be -- or may not be able to become what they want it to be. But, I don&#039;t know why, I was always on Finnikin&#039;s side. (Like that time in the end when all the women ganged up on him in Beatriss&#039;s kitchen and started to lecture him -- I was like, &lt;i&gt;what?&lt;/i&gt; leave Finnikin alone! He can be stubborn if he wants to be.) 

Though it&#039;s true that Evanjalin always seemed to get her way and it &lt;i&gt;was&lt;/i&gt; scary to cross her.

I&#039;ll make a post and put it up later today. Promise :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well I would probably decide to just go along with Evanjalin since somehow one would find themselves following her way regardless!  But I actually thought Finnikin was right at first because their people had gone through so much that it seemed like the better idea to move on and finally settle.  But Lumatere is a pretty exceptional place, especially when comparing it to the other kingdoms in Skuldenore, and I think the way it&#039;s described, and how they bring their homeland back to life makes it seem pretty magical.  Definitely worth it in the end.]]></description>
