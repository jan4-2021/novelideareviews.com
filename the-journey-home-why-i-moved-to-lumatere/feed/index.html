		<description><![CDATA[Ha! GOOD!! Mission accomplished ;D Since my purpose in life is to make people read Finnikin and then hug them when the feels overwhelm them afterward! I feel the same way -- the Lumatere series never fails to remind me just WHY I love reading high fantasy so much. And you&#039;re right, she does an amazing job of making an entirely different world, a cast of fictional characters, and a pile of fictional problems translate so well from fantasy to reality. Powerful and beautiful are two words that describe Melina Marchetta&#039;s writing just perfectly. On that note, time to go throw out all MY writing cause there&#039;s no point in me writing when someone as amazing as Melina is out in the world writing books like this hahahaha /cries]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I fell in love with this book a little bit more just reading this post, Paola! You were able to nail down all the reasons I adore this book. Its been a while since I&#039;ve read something high fantasy and this book reminded me why I love the genre. And even more than that, I &lt;i&gt;loved&lt;/i&gt; beyond words how Melina was able to make it so relevant to today. It really impressed me how the way the exiles were treated in other countries was a parallel to how refugees are treated and even how immigrants in America are shunned (though I know Melina&#039;s from Australia, the case is the same there). The one line about how exiles had to speak the language of the land they were in or no language at all? The times Finnikin reflected on how once powerful men now had to rely on their children to translate for them and shoulder&#039;s were forever slumped in shame? It&#039;s so powerful and beautiful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[#TrevanionBearHug!!! Stop, don&#039;t make me all teary-eyed again &gt;&lt; Also you&#039;re not just coming to see me, you&#039;re gonna live next door. All four duchesses should live within shouting distance of each other so we can run to one another&#039;s houses and eat cake and flail about things together at any point during the day. LOL. 

Sending you ALL the Lumatere love!! &lt;3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh geez, TOTALLY BLUSHING NOW!!! Thank you so much, Shannelle! I sincerely hope you pick up Finnikin some day. More than that, I hope it provides you with both a new book to love AND an escape from reality. Obviously, it comes highly recommended from me, haha!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Paola, if that was a speech, you would have a standing ovation. So let me give you a digital standing ovation. 

It&#039;s clear that you really loved this book, and I wish I could read it. Fantasy is a great genre for me, because it fulfills all of my bookish needs. There&#039;s such complexity, and there&#039;s always a bit of magic at some point. It provides a great escape, and all those pages would be wonderful to spend a rainy afternoon with. 

So thank you, Paola, for your enthusiasm! I would definitely pick this up if I see it. Which would happen . . .  next year.]]></description>
