		<description><![CDATA[&quot; I mean, what if you flip to the end to find out if so-and-so dies, and he/she does! Do you keep reading or do you flip out and stop?&quot;

Good question! For me, if a character I was attached to ends up dying and I find out before I reach the end, I DO flip out and get upset and et al etc. But pretty much every single time, I keep reading anyway. (The handful of times I&#039;ve peeked, anyway!) I may be really depressed reading the story knowing that this person is going to die, but in my (apparently really bizarre) view, at least I was prepared for it. I can actually concentrate on what I&#039;m reading now that I&#039;m prepared for the inevitable. Which I realize probably makes 0 sense to most readers out there, but it&#039;s how my brain works!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh it&#039;s definitely true the feels are much MORE when you don&#039;t peek! I definitely don&#039;t peek 90% of the time. I DID peek a little on the very last Harry Potter book and I HAVE NO REGRETS LOL. 

I feel the same way about TV shows btw, I don&#039;t care if I get spoiled for those!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, lists are awesome! *high fives* I am strangely okay with knowing the end but still reading the book regardless. I have no idea how to explain it, but it&#039;s true!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The weird thing is that I hate being spoiled by other people, and would never dream of actually posting spoilers anywhere without marking them first, but I don&#039;t mind at all if I&#039;m the one spoiling myself. I guess my logic is that it would be ridiculous for me to get upset when it was my conscious decision to peek anyway?? Haha. I do understand though that being spoiled can make you put a book down and just give up! 

I usually get so much more out of a book when I read it the second time. It&#039;s such a bummer that re-reading is one of the first things I had to give up when I started blogging full time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, it doesn&#039;t necessarily have to be the very last page for me. I might flip to ALMOST the last page and sort of skim. I mostly just look for hints/clues instead of reading it word for word. Good for you, I don&#039;t have the strength to resist! /cries]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I understand that, definitely! Though oddly enough I find I&#039;m still able to read the &quot;journey&quot; even after knowing the ending. After reading all the comments here it seems I am definitely the minority! Also EXTREMELY lacking in willpower hahaha. 

I have never gotten through Pride &amp; Prejudice to the end -- I&#039;m glad Alix is still my friend despite this hahahaha]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never flipped to a last page in advance because that&#039;d cause me to totally lose motivation to finish it which I bad because I want to know the process but because I know the ending, which may or may not be to my liking, I&#039;ll just be all Meh about it. It&#039;s like how I&#039;m taking forever to finish Pride and Prejudice after being spoiled on the ending by friends talking about The Lizzie Bennett Diaries. :(]]></description>
