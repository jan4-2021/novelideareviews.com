		<description><![CDATA[I agree completely!!! It&#039;s definitely part of the reason why I love fairy tales being retold. I&#039;m always so curious about the characters and their backgrounds, the reasons why things happen and turn out the way they do, etc, and with a retelling you get to learn all those things you normally wouldn&#039;t from just reading. Some authors are so amazing at building entire worlds out of that very simple framework and still making everything fit and make sense. 

A few friends and I are actually retelling some fairytales as a collab writing project, in case you&#039;re interested! http://novelideareviews.com/13/ :)

Definitely read this one! I enjoyed it! And if you haven&#039;t read Shadows on the Moon, actually read that FIRST because it&#039;s absolutely brilliant and one of my favorite Cinderella retellings of all time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love fairytale retellings, too!  I love seeing an author retell a favorite of mine, and developing those characters so much more.  Fairytales are interesting.  They originated by being told orally long before they were ever written down.  That&#039;s why the stories are so barebones, because they&#039;ve been passed down through the oral tradition.  I think the story tellers would embellish the story (and probably explain the characters&#039; motivations more) while telling the story.  I think they would base their stories on the audience&#039;s reactions.

I think that&#039;s part of the reason fairytales are so perfect for retellings.  The story and characters are very barebones, so the author can develop the story and characters to almost anything.

Anyway, enough of my love for fairytale retellings.  I have been meaning to read The Swan Kingdom for awhile now.  This fairytale was actually a huge favorite of mine growing up, and it&#039;s been on my TBR list for way too long.  I&#039;m thinking I should move it to the top ASAP.  So glad to hear how much you loved this book.]]></description>
