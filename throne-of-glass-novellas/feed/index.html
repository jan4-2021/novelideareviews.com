		<description><![CDATA[Awesome! I can\&#039;t wait to see what you think of them, Tory :) I understand about Celaena... I really felt frustrated with her many times throughout the novellas, more frustrated than I ever felt while reading Throne of Glass. I feel like this is intentional. She is younger in the novellas and hasn\&#039;t had all her life-changing epiphany moments yet, haha. 
 
Yes, and I will hug you back! I love Neil Gaiman! Definitely pick up The Graveyard Book. I also recommend Coraline, Neverwhere, and Stardust... I\&#039;m giving away a copy of Stardust at the end of this week, actually. (Well, it\&#039;s one of the book choices.) 
 
I\&#039;m always glad to meet someone who loves the same books I do! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ahhhhhhh, NOW that I&#039;ve read your reviews on the novellas, I think I&#039;m gonna have to read them ASAP! It seems that my love-hate relationship with Celaena will continue on but maybe more to love this time, characters&#039; back stories always helped me to enjoy them more. :&#039;)  
 
...May I also give you a hug for listing Neil Gaiman in your favourite authors? Although the blasphemy of me of having read only 2 of his books. :( I saw that you reviewed The Graveyard Book and I got really excited reading it, it&#039;s one of the books I want to read. :3 (Yeah, I&#039;m digressing from this post so I shall contain my excitement now.) ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Meg! You know, I don\&#039;t usually go for novellas either... the only reason I read these was because of my love for the series. I think it speaks a lot about an author\&#039;s world if I want to spend extra time in it (and spend extra money on it as well lol). I am VERY excited for Crown of Midnight, but I saw some time ago that the author would like the series to stretch to about 7 books total and that kind of scares me to be honest. Anyway, if you do decide to give them a try, I hope you enjoy! ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never really felt obliged to read the prequels (mostly because I don&#039;t think I&#039;m as excited as you for the release of Crown of Midnight), but it&#039;s nice knowing that you enjoyed them so much! I think it&#039;s great how Sarah Maas manages to &quot;fill in the missing details of Celaena&#039;s life&quot; before ToG, since, if I&#039;m not mistaken, she wrote these before writing the first book. You have me quite intrigued to try these out, even though I&#039;m known for not reading novellas (never saw the need for them, heh).  
 
Great reviews! ]]></description>
