		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been hearing this from a few people. The cover is so pretty and the premise so interesting. Too bad it wasn&#039;t done well and had odd plot points. Great review :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wait! Did I make it sound like Sienna&#039;s dad was marrying a teenager??? *goes back to reread* Maybe I worded it weird? *edits* The part about Caden and the prostitute IS TOTALLY ON POINT. Like WHY STORY? WHY??? Such a weird choice! OH and then he has crush on his step-mother and we get that pervy inner monologued and the expected clichÃ© resolution that, if you know what mean!

Yeah I just keep waiting and turning corner after corner until the corner was the end. I&#039;m so disappointed cause the book had so much potential and I was so excited to read it!

My pleasure! :) #cobloggerhighfive]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay so reading through your review I feel kind of weirded out by some of the things that happened in this story?? The prostitute thing was bizarre + Sienna&#039;s dad was marrying a teenager??? O__O

I know that feeling of sticking around just cause you&#039;re waiting for something awesome, you keep thinking it&#039;s right around the corner up until it ends but nothing ever happens. Bleh. Agree with you about the really interesting premise and the cover is beautiful but I&#039;m bummed that it was disappointing.

(THANKS FOR REVIEWING!! #cobloggerhighfive)]]></description>
