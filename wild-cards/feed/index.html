		<description><![CDATA[Haha well they are step-aunt and step-nephew. But they&#039;ve never had met before and are the same age! :P I thought it was a cool premise in the sense that it was an &quot;original&quot; complication for them to have and I was intrigued how they would addressed it... which ended up being not addressing it at all.

Brandi is totally a typical ditzy character name!

I guess so. According to the cover she&#039;s a NYT bestseller but I&#039;ve never heard of her (which isn&#039;t saying a lot). Oh and I didn&#039;t even mention how much I disliked the writing style: 1st person present tense! UGH.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[.... Wait, what???? What is this about being step-siblings???!! :O

Also is it just me or is &quot;Brandi&quot; a really typical name for a &quot;ditzy stepmom&quot; character....??

Sorry this one didn&#039;t really work out for you! Isn&#039;t Simone Elkeles a pretty big name in YA contemporary or something...? /is clueless]]></description>
